## 📚 Core Concepts (The "What")

### Meta-Agentics
*Definition:* The discipline of designing agents whose primary function is to create, configure, or improve other agents.
*   **Meta-Prompting**: Writing prompts that generate other prompts.
*   **The "Expertise File"**: A dedicated memory file (YAML/MD) where an agent records its learned lessons and "mental model" of a domain, distinct from the codebase.

### Active Working Memory
*Definition:* Systems that maintain context across sessions not just through vector stores, but through structured, editable documents (Semantic Memory).

## 🛠️ Design Patterns (The "How")

| Pattern Name | Description | Source Video/Docs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Plan -> Build -> Improve** | The fundamental loop for Agent Experts. 1. Plan the change. 2. Execute code. 3. Update the Expertise File with what worked/didn't. | [Agent Experts](transcripts/indy_dev_dan/zTcDwqopvKE.json) |
| **The "Supervisor"** | An agent that delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents (e.g., Coder, Reviewer, Tester). | *Pending Ingestion* |
| **Tool-Use First** | Designing agents primarily around their tool definitions (MCP, Function Calling) rather than just prompt engineering. | *Google AI Cookbook* |

    *   *Key Insight:* Separation of "Source of Truth" (Code) from "Mental Model" (Expertise File).

## 📝 Roadmap & Strategy
*   [ ] **Ingest IndyDevDan Channel**: Extract remaining patterns.
*   [ ] **Synthesize "Meta-Agent"**: Build a specialized agent prompt based on these learnings.
*   [ ] **Implement "Expertise Files"**: Add `checklist.md` or `patterns.md` to Project Jules memory.
