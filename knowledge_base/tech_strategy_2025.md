# Who Visions / Ai with Dav3 Technical Strategy (2025)

## Core Philosophy: "All-In on Google"
We are shifting from a fragmented stack (OpenAI + Cursor + Perplexity) to a unified **Google AI Ecosystem**. This is an asymmetric bet on Google's vertical integration, hardware dominance (TPUs), and "founding mode" resurgence.

## Strategic Pillars

### 1. The Development Environment: "Antigravity"
- **IDE:** **Anti-Gravity** (Agentic IDE / Project IDX). We prioritize agentic workflows where we manage agents ("Project Jewels") rather than just writing code.
    - **Agent Tool:** **Project Jules** (`npm install -g @google/jules`). Use this to assign issues and have it autonomously create branches and fix bugs.
    - **Meta-Agentics:** Implement **Agent Experts** that maintain their own "Expertise Files" (YAML/MD) to learn code patterns over time.
- **CLI:** **Gemini CLI** replaces Claude Code.
- **Browser:** **Chrome** is the native runtime for our agents, allowing deep integration for testing and automation.

### 2. The Model Stack
- **Primary Intelligence:** **Gemini 3.0** (The "Work" Update).
    - **Key Features:** True Multimodality (Video+Audio linked), Active Working Memory (Conflict Detection), **Generative Surfaces** (Interactive Dashboards).
    - **Reference:** See `knowledge_base/google_ai_cookbook.md` for initialization code and patterns.
- **Utility Model:** **GPT Image 1.5** (OpenAI).
    - Use for: UI Mockups, Text Rendering, Quick Social Assets (when free tier allows).

### 3. Vertical Integration & Value
- **Compute:** Leverage Google's TPU advantage for massive context windows (2M+ tokens) and lower costs.
- **Knowledge:** Use **Deep Research** (Google Search Index) over wrappers like Perplexity.
- **Content:** Use **NotebookLM** for ingesting YouTube/Docs content natively.

## Goals
- Build a fully autonomous software team using Google's agentic tools.
- Establish "Ai with Dav3" as a leading voice in the Google AI ecosystem.
- Validate the "All-In" hypothesis over a 90-day period.
