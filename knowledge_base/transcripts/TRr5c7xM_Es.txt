🎓 **Workflow Extraction** (Gemini 3 Pro)
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRr5c7xM_Es

Here is the actionable workflow for directing headshot subjects using the "Camera Prodding" and layering techniques described by Peter Hurley.

### **Tools & Settings**
*   **Camera:** DSLR or Mirrorless.
*   **Focus Mode:** Single Point Auto-Focus.
*   **Technique:** Focus on the front eye (closest to camera), hold focus, and recompose downwards/outwards to frame the shot.

### **Workflow: Layering Headshot Direction**

This workflow is designed to be executed in a specific sequence (layers). Do not start with "Camera Prodding" immediately; ease the client into the movements using verbal and hand gestures first.

#### **1. Phase 1: Verbal Direction (The Warm-up)**
**Timestamp:** 06:15
Start with standard verbal commands to get the subject moving before introducing complex gestures.
*   **Action:** Instruct the subject simply: "Turn your head left," "Turn right," "Chin up," or "Chin down."
*   **Goal:** Establish basic communication and get the subject comfortable moving their head independent of their body.

#### **2. Phase 2: Hand Gestures (Visual Cues)**
Once the subject is moving, use hand gestures to refine the angle and tilt. Choose the gesture that feels most natural to you or the situation.

*   **The "Suction Cup"**
    *   **Timestamp:** 00:37
    *   **Action:** Hold your hand up as if gripping a large ball. Tell the subject to imagine your hand is suction-cupped to their face. Tilt your hand; they mirror the tilt.
*   **The "Finger Lead" (For Nose Direction)**
    *   **Timestamp:** 01:01
    *   **Action:** Hold up one finger. Instruct the subject: "Follow my finger with your nose." Move your finger to place their nose exactly where you want it.
*   **The "Karate Chop" (For Head Tilt)**
    *   **Timestamp:** 00:50
    *   **Action:** Hold a flat hand (karate chop style) in the air to indicate the angle of the face.
    *   **Note:** This is best used *after* the nose is positioned (via the Finger Lead) to dial in the specific tilt.

#### **3. Phase 3: Camera Prodding (The Advanced Layer)**
**Timestamp:** 01:12 - 02:30
Introduce this only after the subject is "warmed up" and understands the flow. This expedites the process by removing the need to take your eye off the viewfinder.

*   **Concept:** Use the physical movement of the camera body to signal where the subject should move their face.
*   **Action:**
    1.  While looking through the viewfinder (or just above it), jerk or tilt the camera in the direction you want their nose to go.
    2.  **Example:** If you want them to look more to the left, physically move the camera to the left.
    3.  **Focusing:** Lock focus on the front eye using your single point, then "prod" (move camera), let them adjust, recompose, and shoot.
*   **Why it works:** It keeps the shoot "live" and fast-paced, preventing the subject from overthinking their expression.

#### **4. Phase 4: Refining the "Good Side"**
**Timestamp:** 03:40
Once you identify the subject's best angle (based on jawline definition or lighting highlights), lock it in using micro-adjustments.

*   **The "Freeze" Command:** When they hit the perfect angle, say "Freeze."
*   **Micro-adjustments:** Use the "Karate Chop" or verbal cues to adjust by millimeters.
    *   *Instruction:* "Go back an inch" or "Tilt a little less."
*   **Abstract Verbal Cues:** Use weird instructions to break tension or get micro-movements.
    *   *Example (05:05):* "Narrow the distance between your nose and the window."
    *   *Example (04:30):* "Tilt towards the Canadian border" (Use humor/confusion to reset their expression).

#### **5. Phase 5: Continuous Movement (The Flow)**
**Timestamp:** 03:05
*   **Goal:** Do not shoot the same frame twice.
*   **Action:** Encourage the subject to move slightly after every shutter click.
*   **Instruction:** "Every time I take a picture, move a little bit. Hit your angle, hit your good side."
*   **Result:** This keeps the brain engaged on movement rather than "posing," resulting in more natural expressions.
