    "Fashion Gray is a versatile middle-ground choice that is neutral enough to be easily manipulated.",
    "You can change the brightness of a background significantly just by feathering the light (changing its angle).",
    "V-Flats are useful for both blocking light (to darken backgrounds) and reflecting light (to fill shadows).",
    "Neutral gray backgrounds are ideal for color grading in post-production as they easily take on cool or warm tints."
