  "key_takeaways": [
    "Using a colored gel (red) as a backlight creates immediate drama and unites the color palette with the styling.",
    "A 5-degree grid is effective for precise, isolated lighting on a subject's face in a dark environment.",
    "Wide-angle lenses often require perspective correction in post-processing.",
    "Post-processing color grading (e.g., split toning) helps unify the ambient light with the strobe lighting."
