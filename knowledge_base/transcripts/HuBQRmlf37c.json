    "Use complementary colors (like blue and orange) to create visual contrast and impact.",
    "Cool colors tend to recede while warm colors pop, adding depth to the image.",
    "When using colored gels on white walls, high intensity can shift colors (e.g., orange appearing yellow).",
    "Post-processing is often needed to balance exposure between bright gelled backgrounds and darker gelled subjects."
