  "title": "How to Remove Glare from Glasses in Headshot Photography",
  "summary": "Photographer Peter Hurley demonstrates practical techniques to eliminate glare and reflections from eyeglasses during a photoshoot. He covers three main variables: adjusting the light position, changing the subject's angle, and physically tilting the glasses.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "time": "00:54",
      "action": "Take a test shot to identify exactly where the glare is appearing on the subject's eyes.",
      "tool": "Camera"
    },
    {
      "time": "02:37",
      "action": "Raise the key lights higher. This changes the angle of reflection, moving the glare higher up on the lens, potentially out of the eye line.",
      "tool": "Lighting Stand"
    },
    {
      "time": "03:02",
      "action": "Instruct the subject to tilt their chin down slightly. Watch the reflection move until it sits at the top of the frame or disappears, ensuring it doesn't cover the pupil.",
      "tool": "None"
    },
    {
      "time": "04:29",
      "action": "Physically tilt the glasses forward by lifting the temples (arms) of the glasses off the subject's ears. This angles the lenses downward, reflecting the darker floor instead of the lights.",
      "tool": "Glasses"
    },
    {
      "time": "05:16",
      "action": "Have the subject hold the tilted glasses position and adjust their chin down slightly to finalize the angle where glare is eliminated.",
      "tool": "None"
    },
    {
      "time": "07:53",
      "action": "For stubborn glasses, combine all methods: raise the lights slightly, tilt the glasses off the ears, and have the subject lower their chin.",
      "tool": "Lighting Stand"
    }
  ],
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Avoid removing lenses from frames as it makes the photo look unnatural.",
    "There are three variables to control glare: Light Position, Subject Position, and Glasses Angle.",
    "Raising the lights moves the reflection higher on the lens.",
    "Tilting the glasses forward (lifting the arms off the ears) is a highly effective trick that is usually unnoticeable in the final headshot.",
    "Every pair of glasses has different curvature and coatings, so you must experiment with the three variables for each subject."
