  "key_takeaways": [
    "Use optical spots to create precise shapes and slices of light for dramatic effect.",
    "Bounce a bare strobe off the back wall/ceiling to create a soft, omnidirectional fill that lifts shadows without adding directional distractions.",
    "Incorporate physical props like mirrored plexiglass and lens filters to add layers of visual interest and reflections in-camera.",
    "Use color grading (specifically split toning highlights and shadows) to reinforce the mood and theme of the shoot."
