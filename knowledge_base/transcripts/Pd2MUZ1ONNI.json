  "title": "Dramatic Clamshell Lighting Photo Deconstruction",
  "summary": "Lindsay Adler demonstrates a dramatic variation of the traditional clamshell lighting setup. By using hard, gridded lights instead of soft modifiers, she creates a sculpted, high-contrast portrait. The tutorial covers the three-light setup, the use of ND gels to manage strobe power, and post-processing techniques including Generative Fill.",

  "key_takeaways": [
    "Clamshell lighting can be used for dramatic, sculpted results using hard light modifiers like grids.",
    "A 5-degree grid creates an extremely narrow and concentrated beam of light.",
    "ND gels are crucial for lowering the output of powerful strobes when shooting at wide apertures or low ISOs.",
    "Hard light can be flattering and doesn't always require extensive skin retouching.",
    "Generative Fill is highly effective for cleaning up messy hair edges in post-production."
