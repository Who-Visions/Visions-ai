Here is the actionable workflow for determining the best facial angle based on hair parting, extracted from the tutorial video.

### **Workflow: "Sherlock Holmesing" the Face & Hair Part Strategy**

**Goal:** Determine the subject's "sweet spot" and avoid blocking the face with hair by analyzing the relationship between the facial angle and the hair part.

#### **1. Analyze the Subject's Natural Preferences**
*   **Step:** Observe the angle the subject naturally presents to you when talking. This is often their subconscious "sweet spot."
*   **Step:** Identify the direction of the hair part (Left vs. Right).
    *   *Note:* 90% of the time, the hair part aligns with the subject's "sweet spot" to open up the face.
*   **Timestamp:** 00:00 - 00:40

#### **2. Apply the "Open Side" Rule**
*   **Concept:** The "Open Side" is the side of the face the hair is parted *away* from.
*   **Action:** Position the camera to shoot into the open side of the face.
*   **Why:** This ensures the face is framed by the hair rather than obscured by it. It allows the "mojo" of the face to be visible.
*   **Timestamp:** 01:25 - 01:33

#### **3. Avoid the "Reverse Hair Part"**
*   **Concept:** The "Reverse Hair Part" is shooting the side of the face where the part actually sits (the "back side" of the hair).
*   **Warning:** Shooting this angle usually results in the hair acting as a wall, blocking the eye line and facial features. It often creates a "clump" of hair pointing at the lens.
*   **Action:** Unless there is a specific reason, avoid shooting the side where the hair creates a visual block.
*   **Timestamp:** 01:06 - 01:55 / 03:09

#### **4. Exception Handling (Shooting the "Bad" Side)**
If you must shoot the side with the hair part (the "closed" side) or if the subject is ambifacial:
*   **Technique A (The Ear Tuck):** Tuck the hair behind the ear on the parting side to manually "open" the face.
    *   *Timestamp:* 02:10
*   **Technique B (The Ponytail):** Pull the hair back entirely to remove the hair part variable and see the face structure clearly.
    *   *Timestamp:* 04:45
*   **Technique C (The Flip):** Ask the subject to flip their hair part to the opposite side to see if it favors the other angle better.
    *   *Timestamp:* 04:55

#### **5. Verification & Selection**
*   **Step:** Shoot both angles (the "Open Side" and the "Reverse Part") during the session to compare.
*   **Analysis:** Review the images. Look for "dorkiness" or visual obstruction in the Reverse Part shots (referenced using the Mark Wahlberg *Ted 2* poster example).
*   **Action:** Curate the portfolio to prioritize the "Open Side" shots unless the Reverse Part is exceptionally flattering for a specific reason.
*   **Timestamp:** 05:02 - 06:35
