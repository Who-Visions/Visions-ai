  "title": "Peter Hurley's 3-Light Strobe Headshot Setup",
  "summary": "Photographer Peter Hurley demonstrates how to replicate his signature flat, window-light look using a three-light strobe setup. He details the specific arrangement of softboxes and strip lights to create a triangular aperture and explains critical positioning techniques to ensure even illumination without unwanted shadows.",

  "key_takeaways": [
    "A triangular strobe setup can effectively mimic the look of continuous window light.",
    "Using strip boxes on the sides allows the lighting setup to be more condensed than using three standard softboxes.",
    "Mixing modifiers from different manufacturers can lead to color shifts on the subject.",
    "The subject must be positioned behind the light convergence point to achieve a truly flat light without side shadows."
