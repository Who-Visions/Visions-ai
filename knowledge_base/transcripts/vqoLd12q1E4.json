  "title": "Mastering the Hurley Triangle Lighting Setup with Profoto Strobes",
  "summary": "Peter Hurley demonstrates how to recreate his signature 'Hurley Triangle' lighting configuration using Profoto strobes and softboxes. He explains the specific gear used, the importance of feathering lights, and builds the lighting setup step-by-step to achieve a shadowless beauty headshot.",

  "key_takeaways": [
    "The Hurley Triangle consists of three lights: two side lights and one bottom light.",
    "Feathering the side lights (pointing them past the subject) creates a soft wrap of light around the face.",
    "The bottom light is crucial for eliminating shadows and is considered the 'money light'.",
    "Subject placement is key; they must be close to the source for soft light but not in front of the light convergence.",
    "Using modeling lights at full power helps constrict pupils for better eye color in the final shot."
