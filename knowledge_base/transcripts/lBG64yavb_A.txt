🎓 **Workflow Extraction** (Gemini 3 Pro)
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBG64yavb_A

Here is the actionable workflow for directing photography subjects, based on Peter Hurley’s "Shtick" method.

### **Tools Required**
*   **Analog Setup:** Paper, Pen, Tape (Gaffer or Scotch), Studio Lights (Strobes/Continuous).
*   **Digital Setup:** Tethered Computer/Laptop, Google Docs (or any cloud-based note app).
*   **Props:** FedEx Envelope (for jawline demonstration), "Face Sheet" (grid of facial expressions).

### **Workflow: The "Write It Down & Stick It Up" Method**

#### **1. The Capture Phase (Building Your "Shtick")**
*   **01:30 - 02:00**: **Record Successful Directives.** Whenever you say something during a shoot that elicits a genuine reaction or great expression, write it down immediately. Do not rely on memory.
*   **02:50**: **Filter Your List.** If a phrase stops working or feels stale, remove it. Only keep the directives that consistently get results.
*   **05:45**: **Create a "Hurleyisms" Document.** Compile these notes into a master document. This serves as your safety net when you are tired, stressed, or uninspired.

#### **2. The Analog Display Method (Low Tech)**
*   **01:35**: **Tape Notes to Lights.**
    *   Write your best keywords, phrases, and scenarios on a piece of paper.
    *   Tape this paper to the back of your main light source or key light.
    *   **Why:** This allows you to glance at your "cheat sheet" without breaking eye contact with the subject or looking down at a phone.

#### **3. The Digital Display Method (High Tech)**
*   **09:53**: **Use a Tethered Screen.**
    *   Open a Google Doc on the computer you are tethered to.
    *   Keep the font large and readable from your shooting position.
    *   **Benefit:** Google Docs auto-saves, allowing you (or an assistant) to add new ideas in real-time during a shoot without losing data.

#### **4. Categorizing Your Directives (Parameters & Examples)**
Hurley breaks his direction down into specific categories. Use these examples to build your own list:

*   **Single Word Cues (Adjectives/Emotions) [05:05]:**
    *   *Examples:* "Delighted," "Sneaky," "Flirtatious," "Suave," "Mysterious," "Horny" (use with caution/humor), "Skeptical," "Studly," "Devious," "Mischievous," "Debonair."
*   **Visual Scenarios [03:45]:**
    *   *Examples:* "Spiked blonde biker chick," "Collect umbrellas," "Apple picker," "Look like you know what you're doing."
*   **Physical Micro-Adjustments [04:40]:**
    *   *Examples:* "Forehead down," "Pinch" (referring to the lower eyelid/squinch), "Tilt your head towards the Statue of Liberty."
*   **Roleplay/Reactionary Phrases [07:40]:**
    *   Say a phrase to the client to get them to react *back* to you with a specific face.
    *   *Examples:* "You've got to be kidding me," "Were you just checking me out?", "I told you so," "Don't f*** with me."
*   **The "Mental" Technique [11:25]:**
    *   Instruct the client to do an action *only in their mind* to achieve a subtle expression.
    *   *Examples:* "Mentally smile," "Mentally rotate," "Mentally twist."

#### **5. Execution & Delivery**
*   **07:18**: **Use Props.** Keep a FedEx envelope nearby (Hurley uses this to demonstrate jawline definition) and a printed sheet of facial expressions to help clients visualize what you want.
*   **12:00**: **Commit to the Bit.** Even if the phrase is ridiculous (e.g., "Relax your esophagus"), say it with absolute belief. If you don't believe it, the subject won't react.
*   **06:20**: **Refresh the List.** If you feel yourself slumping, force yourself to use a new or forgotten phrase from your list to change the energy of the shoot.
