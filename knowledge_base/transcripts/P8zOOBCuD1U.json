    "Posing is not just body position; it relies on focal length and perspective.",
    "Whatever is closest to the camera appears largest.",
    "Wide-angle lenses exaggerate distance and size; long lenses compress and flatten perspective.",
    "Camera height determines which part of the body is closest to the lens, altering perceived proportions."
