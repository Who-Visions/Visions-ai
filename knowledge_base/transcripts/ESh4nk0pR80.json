    "Do not over-light saturated red backgrounds, as it can wash out the color or turn it orange.",
    "Use Neutral Density (ND) gels to reduce strobe power below its minimum setting for subtle effects.",
    "Hard lighting sources like optical spots will emphasize skin texture, requiring careful retouching.",
    "Monochromatic images rely on texture, depth, and varied lighting to create visual interest."
