  "key_takeaways": [
    "Layer your direction techniques: start simple with verbal/hand cues and progress to camera prodding for efficiency.",
    "Constant movement prevents the subject from overthinking their expression.",
    "Camera prodding works best later in the session when a rhythm has been established.",
    "Micro-adjustments in head angle can significantly impact the quality of the headshot."
