  ],
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Bouncing a single light creates soft illumination but offers less control over background whiteness.",
    "Negative fill is essential in white-on-white photography to prevent the subject from blending into the background.",
    "A two-light setup allows for 'layering' exposure, letting you expose the dress and face independently.",
    "To achieve a commercially pure white background while retaining subject contrast, a three-light setup with dedicated background lighting is necessary."
