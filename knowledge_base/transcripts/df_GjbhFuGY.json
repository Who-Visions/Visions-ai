  "title": "Vibrant Fashion Photography: Color Theory, Lighting & Workflow",
  "summary": "Fashion photographer Lindsay Adler demonstrates a complete workflow for a high-contrast, colorful fashion shoot. The tutorial covers selecting a color harmony, calibrating equipment, building a multi-light setup with gels and continuous lighting, using shutter drag techniques, and final color grading.",

  "key_takeaways": [
    "Start with a deliberate color harmony (e.g., split complementary) to guide lighting and styling choices.",
    "Color management tools like calibrators and color checkers are essential for accurate results.",
    "To mix strobes with continuous light, slow down the shutter speed (drag the shutter) to let the continuous light register.",
    "Build lighting setups one light at a time to understand the contribution of each source.",
    "Atmospheric tools like haze and diffusion filters add depth and 'bloom' to highlights."
