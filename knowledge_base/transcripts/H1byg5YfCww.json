    "Directing the subject's micro-movements (chin, nose, shoulders) is essential for a polished look.",
    "Lighting placement is critical, specifically how it creates catchlights in the eyes.",
    "A major part of headshot photography is psychological: getting the subject to relax and stop 'performing' for the camera.",
    "Reviewing and critiquing work immediately helps in understanding lighting and angles.",
    "Confidence in your own style (e.g., white background, horizontal crop) is key to professional success."
