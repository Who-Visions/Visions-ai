Here is the actionable workflow for implementing professional hair and makeup into a headshot photography business, based on Peter Hurley’s tutorial.

### **Professional Hair & Makeup Workflow for Headshots**

#### **1. Establish the "Pro" Policy**
*   **The Rule:** Make professional hair and makeup **mandatory for women**. Do not allow female clients to do their own makeup unless it is a corporate contract with tight time constraints or a rush job.
*   **The Reason:** Self-applied makeup often results in a "flat" look due to heavy powders, whereas professional application adds luminescence and reduces retouching time. It also boosts client confidence ("The Feel").
*   **Pricing Strategy:** If clients are budget-conscious, maintain a roster of makeup artists (MUAs) at different price points (e.g., a "main guy" and cheaper junior options) rather than allowing no makeup artist at all.

#### **2. Men’s Grooming Protocol**
*   **Philosophy:** Do **not** use heavy makeup on men. It looks artificial. Only cover severe acne or skin conditions if absolutely necessary.
*   **Actionable Steps:**
    1.  **Moisturizer:** Apply if skin is dry or flaky.
    2.  **Lip Care:** Apply ChapStick or balm for dry lips.
    3.  **Hair:** Use grooming products to style hair.
    4.  **The "Secret" Tool:** Use an **Eyelash Curler**.
        *   *Why:* To lift straight lashes out of the way of the pupil/iris to ensure the eyes are visible and catchy.

#### **3. Recruiting the Right Talent (Finding an MUA)**
*   **The Requirement:** The artist must be proficient in **both** Hair and Makeup. Do not hire someone who only does makeup; hair volume and styling are critical for headshots.
*   **The Aesthetic:** Look for "Natural, Clean, Simple, and Beautiful." Avoid artists who specialize in heavy, "drag-style," or over-the-top makeup.
*   **Sourcing Strategy (Major Markets):** Contact agents and casting directors to see who they use.
*   **Sourcing Strategy (Smaller Markets):**
    *   Go to high-end department stores.
    *   **Avoid:** MAC or Sephora counters (often too heavy/self-promotional styles).
    *   **Target:** High-end skincare/makeup counters like **Shiseido, Dior, Clé de Peau, or La Mer**.
    *   **The Hack:** Ask the staff at the *cream/skincare* counters (not the makeup counters) who the best makeup artist in the store is.
    *   **Vetting:** Check their website/portfolio specifically for natural looks.

#### **4. The "Amp Up" (Technical Analysis)**
When reviewing the MUA's work on set or in test shoots, look for these specific improvements over self-done makeup:
*   **Skin:** Look for **luminescence** and reflective quality (moisturizer-based) rather than a flat, matte finish caused by heavy powder.
*   **Eyes:** Brows should be filled and shaped; mascara should be subtle but defining.
*   **Cheeks:** Blush should be applied specifically to the "apple" of the cheek to create dimension.
*   **Hair:** Look for significant improvement in **volume**. Flat hair kills a headshot.
*   **Variety:** The MUA should be able to change the hair look (e.g., putting it up) to create a "kick" on the cheek and provide variety in the portfolio.

#### **5. On-Set Workflow**
*   **Trust the Team:** Once you have established the look with your MUA, do not micromanage.
*   **Communication:** Stop talking to the MUA during the shoot. Work in unison where they know your aesthetic and step in to fix hair/shine without being told.
*   **Client Psychology:** Use the hair and makeup session to relax the client and boost their confidence before they step in front of the camera.
