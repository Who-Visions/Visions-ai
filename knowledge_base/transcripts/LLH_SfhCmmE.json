  ],
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Utilize a wide-angle lens (e.g., 28mm) to capture both the subjects and the environment when space is limited or the subject is large.",
    "Expect to shoot a significantly higher volume of frames than usual when working on a moving platform like a boat.",
    "Active direction of subjects is crucial for getting clean shots in a chaotic environment.",
    "Be adaptable to harsh lighting conditions, such as backlighting, which are common in outdoor marine photography."
