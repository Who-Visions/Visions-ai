  "summary": "Lindsay Adler breaks down a creative studio lighting setup to create a high-impact, colorful portrait using only two lights. The tutorial covers the specific gear used, the placement of flags to control light spill, and the post-processing steps required to correct contrast and fine-tune the color grade.",

  "key_takeaways": [
    "Complex-looking rim lighting can be achieved with a single softbox blocked by a flag.",
    "Shooting directly into a light source often reduces contrast, requiring recovery in post-production.",
    "Mixing gels (like blue and teal) can create unique color signatures.",
    "Simple gear (2 lights) can yield high-production value results with creative problem solving."
