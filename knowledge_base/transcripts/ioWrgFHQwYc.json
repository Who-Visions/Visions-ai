    "Filter by Style first: Eliminate images based on wardrobe, background, and hair before looking at expressions.",
    "Use the 'Apples to Apples' method: Compare similar shots directly against each other to find the subtle differences that make one superior.",
    "Lookability is key: Select the image that has the most engaging connection through the eyes.",
    "Don't compromise: If a session didn't yield a shot that meets your standards, do not include it in your portfolio, regardless of the subject's attractiveness."
