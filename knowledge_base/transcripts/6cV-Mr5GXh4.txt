Of course. Here is a detailed summary of the video about camera height in headshot photography.

### Video Summary

In this humorous and informative video, photographer Peter Hurley explains his strong opinion on the correct camera height for taking powerful headshots. He argues against shooting from a high angle, which he believes diminishes the subject's presence, and introduces his "note the nostrils" rule as a guide to finding the perfect camera position.

### Detailed Breakdown of Key Points

**1. The Problem with High-Angle Shots (0:12 - 0:41)**
*   **Main Point:** Hurley's number one pet peeve is when photographers shoot headshots from a high angle, looking down on the subject.
*   **Reasoning:** He believes this technique, which he calls "cheese factor 75," diminishes the subject's power and makes them look subservient. He traces this trend back to the 1980s and emphatically states it should never be done.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Avoid placing your camera significantly above your subject's eye level for headshots, as it can create a weak or unflattering look.

**2. The "Note the Nostrils" Rule (0:41 - 1:13)**
*   **Main Point:** To determine the correct camera height, Hurley advises photographers to "note the nostrils." The goal is to position the camera so you are not looking up into the subject's nostrils.
*   **Demonstration:** He uses extreme close-ups to show how an upward camera angle (shooting from below) reveals too much of the inside of the nose, which is an unflattering perspective.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Use the visibility of the subject's nostrils as a quick visual guide. If you can see straight up their nose, your camera is too low. If you are looking down on the top of their head, it's too high.

**3. The Ideal Camera Height: The Earlobe Rule (1:14 - 1:54)**
*   **Main Point:** Hurley's preferred camera height is to align the center of the lens with the bottom of the subject's earlobe or their jawline.
*   **Demonstration:** He measures the height from the floor to the subject's (Carl's) earlobe, which is 64 inches. He then sets his camera to that exact height.
*   **Actionable Insight:** As a starting point, position your camera so the lens is level with the subject's jawline or the bottom of their ear. This creates a direct, powerful, and engaging connection with the viewer.

**4. Adjusting Camera Height for Posing (1:55 - 2:51)**
*   **Main Point:** The ideal camera height is not static; it must be adjusted based on the subject's pose.
*   **Demonstration:** Hurley directs his subject to drop a shoulder and tilt his head. This action lowers the position of the subject's earlobe by two inches (from 64" to 62"). Consequently, Hurley lowers his camera by two inches to maintain the earlobe-level alignment.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Pay close attention to your subject's posture. If they lean, tilt, or change their pose, you must readjust your camera height to maintain the desired perspective and avoid unintentionally shooting up or down at them.

**5. Comparing the Results: The Nostril Test (2:52 - 3:30 & 4:35 - 5:13)**
*   **Main Point:** After taking two shots—one at the initial 64-inch height and one at the adjusted 62-inch height—Hurley compares them to show the difference.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Higher Shot (64"):** When the camera was too high for the pose, the photo shows the top of the nose, and the nostrils are barely visible.
    *   **Correct Lower Shot (62"):** When the camera was correctly aligned with the lowered earlobe, the photo reveals a slight, natural view of the nostrils and the nasal cavity's shadow. This, he argues, is the more attractive and powerful shot.
*   **Conclusion:** Seeing a little bit of the nostril is good; it indicates you are at a powerful, eye-level (or slightly below) position. Seeing too much (shooting up) or none at all (shooting down) is less ideal.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Use your camera's live view or review your shots to check the "nostril trajectory." A slight, natural view is a good indicator that your camera height is correct for the pose.
