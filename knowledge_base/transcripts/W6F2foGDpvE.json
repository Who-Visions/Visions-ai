  "key_takeaways": [
    "Building a physical corner with backdrops prevents the image from looking flat and adds dimension.",
    "Rich, deep red colors often require adding contrast and darkening the image in post-processing; bright reds can look washed out or orange.",
    "To achieve a monochromatic look, it is crucial to separate skin tones from the environment by desaturating and lightening the oranges.",
    "Using a zoom lens (like a 24-105mm) provides flexibility to change composition quickly during a fashion shoot."
