  "key_takeaways": [
    "Collaboration with artists can turn simple materials like scrap paper into high-fashion wardrobe pieces.",
    "Side lighting is crucial for emphasizing texture and shape in monochromatic subjects.",
    "Optical spots with specific gobos can be used to mirror the subject's geometry on the background.",
    "Using a V-flat helps control contrast by lifting deep shadows created by directional main lighting.",
    "Shooting at a higher f-stop (like f/8) keeps projected background patterns sharp and defined."
