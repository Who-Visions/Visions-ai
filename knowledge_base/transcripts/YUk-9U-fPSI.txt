Here is the actionable workflow for managing "Tiny Upper Lip Syndrome" (T.U.L.S.) in headshot photography, based on Peter Hurley’s tutorial.

### **Tools & Prerequisites**
*   **Camera:** Capable of high-resolution stills.
*   **Tethering Setup:** Computer/Monitor connected to the camera for immediate image review (Crucial for this workflow).
*   **Subject:** A client with a naturally thin upper lip or a tendency to purse their lips when closing their mouth.

### **Workflow: Correcting T.U.L.S. (Tiny Upper Lip Syndrome)**

#### **1. Diagnosis and Identification**
*   **0:29 - 1:20:** Identify if the client has **T.U.L.S.** (Tiny Upper Lip Syndrome). This occurs when the client closes their mouth and the tension causes the upper lip to lose girth and disappear.
*   **2:08 - 2:30:** Observe the mechanics of their mouth closure.
    *   Check if the **center of the upper lip** touches the bottom lip first.
    *   Look for **"Lip Jumps"** on the sides (where the lip line isn't smooth because the center is touching but the sides are not fully settled).
*   **2:31 - 2:40:** Watch for **"Smushing."** If the client has to press down to close the mouth completely, it flattens the upper lip and creates unwanted lines.

#### **2. The "Lip Separation" Technique**
*   **3:46 - 4:05:** Instruct the client to release the tension in their mouth.
*   **4:06 - 4:20:** Have the client leave a **small space** between their lips.
    *   **Goal:** This prevents the lip from having anything to push against, stopping the "pursing" effect.
    *   **Result:** The upper lip retains its natural fullness, and the "Lip Jumps" disappear.

#### **3. The "Soft Closure" Technique (The Ideal Look)**
*   **8:03 - 8:25:** Once the client understands the relaxation, ask them to bring the lips together **softly**.
    *   **Instruction:** "Bring the lips together, but keep the upper lip full."
    *   **Goal:** Achieve a closed-mouth look (or a hint of a smile) without the pressure that causes the lip to flatten.
*   **8:50 - 9:00:** Aim for a "hint of a smile" with no pursing. This is generally the most approachable and flattering look.

#### **4. Troubleshooting Common Issues**
*   **6:00 - 6:45:** **Fixing "Lip Stick":**
    *   If the lips are slightly apart but sticking together in specific spots (creating "bridges" of skin or saliva), instruct the client to pop them open.
    *   Ensure there is a clean separation or a clean closure, not a sticky middle ground.
*   **10:18 - 10:45:** **Managing the "Held Back" Smile:**
    *   Watch out for clients trying too hard to hide their teeth. This often results in severe pursing.
    *   Encourage them to relax the jaw; if a little tooth shows, it is often better than a non-existent upper lip.
*   **3:20 - 3:40:** **Handling Asymmetry:**
    *   If one side of the lip closes before the other, have the client turn their head slightly.
    *   Turn the "good side" (the side without the lip jump) toward the camera to hide the mechanical issue on the far side.

#### **5. Client Education & Tethering**
*   **11:00 - 11:30:** **Shoot Tethered.** This is non-negotiable for this technique.
*   **12:20 - 12:40:** Show the client the images on the monitor.
    *   Show them the "Before" (pursed, thin lip) vs. the "After" (relaxed, full lip).
    *   **Why:** Clients are often unaware they are doing this. Showing them the difference builds trust and helps them replicate the "good" mouth feel for the rest of the session.
*   **12:50 - 13:10:** Act as their "Personal Brand Manager." Explain that fixing this makes them look more approachable and professional.

#### **6. Post-Processing (Last Resort)**
*   **5:00 - 5:30:** **In-Camera Priority:** Always aim to solve this with lighting and coaching first.
*   **5:25 - 5:45:** **Retouching:** If a great expression has a minor "Lip Jump" (a small gap on the side), this can be filled in during retouching. However, do not rely on retouching to fix a completely flattened/pursed lip.
