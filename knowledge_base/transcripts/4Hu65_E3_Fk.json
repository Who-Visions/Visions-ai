Here is a detailed summary and breakdown of the video \"Photo Deconstruction: Creative Color with Nanlite PavoTubes\" by Lindsay Adler.\n\n### Overall Summary\n\nIn this \"Photo Deconstruction,\" photographer Lindsay Adler breaks down how she created a vibrant and compelling beauty portrait using two **Nanlite PavoTubes** and one additional constant light. She explains her creative inspiration, details the complete three-light setup, shares her camera settings, and walks through the significant color grading and retouching steps in post-production to achieve the final, dramatic image. The key takeaway is how to use RGB tube lights to create unique color combinations and interesting, linear catchlights for a high-impact beauty shot.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n\n#### **1. Introduction & Concept (0:00 - 1:28)**\n\n*   **Goal:** To deconstruct a photo that uses two Nanlite PavoTubes to create a compelling color combination and unique, interesting catchlights in the subject's eyes.\n*   **Inspiration:** The shoot was inspired by an intricate, jeweled headpiece. Lindsay wanted to use multiple colors of light that would reflect off the gems differently depending on how the model posed, creating a dynamic and colorful effect.\n\n#### **2. Lighting & Gear Setup (1:28 - 3:59)**\n\nLindsay used a three-point constant lighting setup.\n\n*   **Main Light (Top): Nanlite PavoTube 30C 4'**\n    *   **Placement:** Positioned directly above the subject's head, pointing down.\n    *   **Color:** Set to a **teal / blue-green** color.\n    *   **Purpose:** To serve as the primary illumination, carve out the model's features, and create the top highlight in the eyes and on the gems.\n\n*   **Fill Light (Bottom): Nanlite PavoTube 30C 4'**\n    *   **Placement:** Positioned below the subject, pointing up.\n    *   **Color:** Set to **red**.\n    *   **Purpose:** To fill in shadows from underneath and add a contrasting color. This completes a **\"clamshell\" lighting pattern** using two complementary colors (red and a version of green).\n\n*   **Background Light: Profoto D1 (using only the modeling light)**\n    *   **Placement:** Aimed at the background behind the subject.\n    *   **Modifier:** A **20-degree grid** was used to create a focused, circular spot of light.\n    *   **Color:** A **magenta gel** was placed over the light.\n    *   **Purpose:** To add a pop of color and separation from the background. Lindsay notes that any constant light source with a grid and gel could achieve this.\n\n#### **3. Camera Settings (3:59 - 4:50)**\n\n*   **Camera:** Canon R5\n*   **Lens:** Canon RF 70-200mm 2.8\n*   **Shutter Speed:** 1/200 sec\n*   **Aperture:** f/2.8 (wide open)\n*   **ISO:** 200\n*   **Actionable Insight:** Lindsay chose the telephoto lens and wide aperture (f/2.8) to achieve a very narrow depth of field. This keeps the subject's eyes perfectly sharp while allowing the jewels further back on the headpiece and necklace to fall into a soft, beautiful blur (bokeh).\n\n#### **4. Post-Processing & Final Result (4:50 - 7:22)**\n\nThe post-processing involved significant color adjustments and targeted retouching.\n\n*   **Initial Color Grading (5:22):** The straight-out-of-camera image had strong teal and red tones. In her RAW processor (like Capture One or Lightroom), Lindsay adjusted the **White Balance and Tint** to shift the entire color palette.\n    *   The **teal/green** main light was shifted to a cooler, more intense **blue**.\n    *   The overall mood changed from a red/green complementary scheme to a more modern **blue/magenta** scheme.\n\n*   **Retouching in Photoshop (6:55):**\n    *   **Cleanup:** Removed distracting elements, such as a piece of the headpiece sticking out on the left side of the frame and bright sparkles in the earrings that drew attention away from the eyes.\n    *   **Liquify Tool:** Subtly lengthened the subject's neck and adjusted the shoulders to create a more elegant line, compensating for the slightly high camera angle.\n    *   **Skin Retouching:** Cleaned up minor texture on the forehead.\n\n#### **5. Alternate Shot (7:22 - 7:51)**\n\n*   Lindsay also shows a second final image from the same shoot. This one is a profile shot that was created using **only the two Nanlite PavoTubes** (the clamshell setup) without the third background light, demonstrating the versatility of the setup.\n\n### Actionable Insights\n\n*   **Use RGB Tube Lights for Creative Catchlights:** Unlike round softboxes, tube lights create unique, linear catchlights that can add a futuristic or high-fashion feel to a portrait.\n*   **Experiment with Colored Clamshell Lighting:** A classic clamshell setup (one light above, one below) can be made more dynamic by using two different, often complementary, colors.\n*   **Don't Be Afraid to Change Colors in Post:** The color you capture in-camera is just a starting point. Use the White Balance and Tint sliders in your RAW editor to dramatically shift the mood and color harmony of your image.\n*   **Control Your Background:** Use a gridded light with a colored gel to add a controlled spot of color to your background, creating depth and enhancing your overall color palette.\n*   **Use Depth of Field Creatively:** In a detailed beauty shot, a narrow depth of field (wide aperture) can be used to guide the viewer's eye to the most important feature (like the eyes) while turning other elements into soft, pleasing shapes and colors.",
