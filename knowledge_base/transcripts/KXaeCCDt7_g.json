Instead of just a photo of a coffee cup, show friends enjoying a conversation over coffee. This creates an emotional connection with the viewer.\n2.  **Master On-Location Lighting:** Don't rely solely on natural light. Learn to control it. A simple and portable kit with a 5-in-1 reflector/diffuser is essential for managing harsh sunlight and filling in shadows.\n3.  **Create Your Own Light:** Be prepared to introduce artificial light (strobes) when needed. As shown in the video, a strobe can help you overcome poor natural light, create separation between your subject and the background, and add a professional, polished look to your images.\n4.  **Scout and Use Your Environment:** The locations\u2014a caf\u00e9, a city street, an underpass\u2014are not just backdrops; they are part of the story. Use leading lines, textures, and environmental elements to add depth and context to your photos.\n5.  **Build a Team:** For more complex shoots, having an assistant to hold reflectors, diffusers, or lights is invaluable. It frees you up to focus on composition, directing the model, and capturing the perfect moment.",
