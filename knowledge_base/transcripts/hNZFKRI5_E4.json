  "key_takeaways": [
    "Soft light sources are often more flattering on darker skin tones to smooth out texture.",
    "Grids on softboxes are essential for controlling lens flare and light spill when using colored gels.",
    "A dramatic color grade can be achieved by desaturating skin tones while hyper-saturating the wardrobe color.",
    "When building a multi-light setup, start with the back/rim lights to clearly see their effect without the main light washing them out."
