Here is a summary of the video.\n\nThe video is a first-person account of the power outage in New York City during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The speaker, a man, is on the rooftop of his building, filming the city skyline at night.\n\n**Key Points & Breakdown:**\n\n*   **0:00 - 0:20:** The video starts with a dark screen and then shakily pans to show the New York City skyline at night. The speaker points out that while uptown has power, downtown is completely dark. He is on the 24th floor, and the power outage extends from 26th Street all the way downtown.\n*   **0:20 - 0:45:** The speaker turns the camera on himself, showing his face against the dark, windy backdrop. He mentions a strong gust of wind just passed and comments on the eerie feeling of seeing only shadows of people walking on the streets below.\n*   **0:45 - 1:15:** He continues to film from his rooftop, noting that he feels relatively safe unless someone unexpectedly comes through the roof door. He highlights the contrast between the dark downtown area and the still-lit Empire State Building, which he finds unbelievable.\n*   **1:15 - 2:30:** The speaker mentions that the power in his area went out around 8:30 or 8:45 PM. He expresses that the situation is more intense than being stuck in an elevator, which he had previously thought was a very intense experience. He also notes the presence of emergency vehicles on the streets.\n*   **2:30 - 3:00:** A sudden, loud siren is heard, and the speaker exclaims in surprise as an emergency vehicle with flashing lights passes below. He comments on how the flashing lights illuminate the otherwise dark street.\n*   **3:00 - 4:00:** The speaker continues to observe the scene, noting the strong, intermittent gusts of wind. He mentions that the wind is so strong it almost blew him backward. He also expresses concern for his boat at the Jersey Shore and mentions a rumor that a bridge in his hometown was taken out by a house.\n*   **4:00 - 4:20:** The speaker descends from the roof into a dark stairwell, using his phone's light to navigate. The emergency lights in the stairwell are flickering and dying.\n*   **4:20 - 4:40:** He arrives back in his apartment, which is lit by candles and the bright light of an iPad. His daughters are seen on the couch, one drawing and the other meditating with candles.\n*   **4:40 - 5:15:** The speaker shows his \"Vagabond\" portable power pack, which he plans to use to recharge his phone and power a lamp, demonstrating its utility during the blackout.\n*   **5:15 - End:** The video concludes with the speaker back at his window, observing more emergency vehicles on the street and commenting on the surreal sight of people walking in the dark. He ends the stream as the rain starts to pick up again.",
