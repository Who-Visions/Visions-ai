  "summary": "Peter Hurley addresses a common mistake photographers make when posing subjects with one shoulder forward. He explains that while dropping the front shoulder accentuates the jawline, photographers often erroneously drop the camera height and tilt it to match, causing the subject to look like they are falling out of the frame. The tutorial demonstrates the correct 'un-tilt' technique to maintain a strong composition.",

  "key_takeaways": [
    "Do not drop the camera height significantly to match a dropped shoulder; keep it around mouth/nose level.",
    "The front shoulder should only drop about an inch to define the jawline; 'less is more'.",
    "Use the 'un-tilt' technique: counter-rotate the camera against the subject's tilt to prevent the body from looking like a triangle sliding out of the frame.",
    "Watch for hair blocking the neck line during turns and adjust accordingly.",
    "Shooting straight on or slightly un-tilted makes the subject look slimmer and more planted in the frame compared to shooting down at an angle."
