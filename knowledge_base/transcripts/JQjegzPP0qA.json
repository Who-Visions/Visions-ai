He emphasizes that you are in \"great hands.\"\n*   **The Value:** He highlights the immense value, stating most of these photographers charge at least $250, making this a massive giveaway to help people get back to work.\n*   **The Goal:** The initiative aims to help you walk with more confidence and improve your personal brand to aid in your job search.\n*   **What's Expected:** You need to (1) show up on time and (2) be coachable and willing to trust your photographer.\n\n**Posing Techniques for a Great Headshot (1:07 - 4:42)**\n*   **The Jawline (1:43):** To create a strong jawline and avoid a double chin, stand up straight and push your forehead/face forward and slightly down towards the camera. It will feel awkward and uncomfortable, but it looks great on camera.\n*   **Avoid \"NEFA-Face\" (2:32):** \"NEFA\" stands for Non-Existent Facial Activity. Avoid a blank, deer-in-the-headlights look. You must consciously control your expression.\n*   **Confidence is in the Eyes (3:32):** To look confident, use the \"squinch.\" This involves slightly tightening your lower eyelids, as if you're focusing intently. Don't squint with your upper lids. Practice this in a mirror.\n*   **Approachability is in the Mouth (3:35):** To look approachable, combine the confident \"squinch\" with a subtle smile. Just slightly bend the corners of your mouth up towards your earlobes. A squinch without a smile can look aggressive.\n\n**Logistics and How to Prepare (4:42 - 7:24)**\n*   **What to Wear (5:30):**\n    *   Wear something you love and feel confident in.\n    *   Dress appropriately for the job or industry you're targeting.\n    *   Layers (like a jacket over a shirt) are a great option.\n    *   Avoid busy patterns and large, distracting jewelry. The focus should be on your face.\n*   **Be Ready (6:21):**\n    *   You only have a 10-minute slot.\n    *   Arrive ready. Check your hair and clothes in a mirror before your session begins.\n*   **Safety Protocols (4:50 & 6:48):**\n    *   You must wear a mask upon arrival. Your first photo will be taken with the mask on for the project's records.\n    *   Social distancing will be maintained; the photographer will not touch you or your clothing, so be prepared to make adjustments yourself.\n\n**Final Message (7:24 - 8:55)**\n*   **Have Fun:** Don't overthink it. The goal is to have a positive experience and leave feeling better about yourself.\n*   **Share Your Story:** After the event, share your experience and how the headshot has helped you in the official Facebook group. These stories are a crucial part of the initiative's success.\n*   **Shabang!:** He ends with his signature catchphrase to get everyone excited.\n\n### Actionable Insights: Your Checklist for the Photoshoot\n\n1.  **Be on Time:** Arrive promptly for your 10-minute appointment.\n2.  **Dress for Success:**\n    *   Choose an outfit you love and feel confident in.\n    *   Dress for the industry you want to work in (e.g., a blazer for corporate, a clean t-shirt for creative).\n    *   Solid colors or simple textures work best. Avoid busy patterns.\n    *   Keep jewelry minimal and not distracting.\n3.  **Arrive Ready:**\n    *   Have your hair and any makeup done before you arrive.\n    *   Do a final check in a mirror just before your session.\n4.  **Practice Your Pose:**\n    *   **Posture:** Stand tall.\n    *   **Jawline:** Push your forehead forward and down toward the lens.\n    *   **Eyes:** Practice the \"squinch\" (tightening your lower eyelids) for a confident look.\n    *   **Mouth:** Add a subtle, slight smile for approachability.\n5.  **Be Coachable:** Listen to your photographer. They are trained experts there to make you look your best.\n6.  **Bring Your Mask:** You will need it for entry and for the first photo.\n7.  **Have Fun!** Relax, trust the process, and enjoy the experience.",
