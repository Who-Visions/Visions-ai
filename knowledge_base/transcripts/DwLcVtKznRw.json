    "A rotating center column kept loose allows for dynamic camera movement while maintaining support.",
    "Tripods are essential for preventing physical fatigue and muscle strain during long shoots.",
    "Stabilization is critical for sharpness when shooting natural light at lower shutter speeds.",
    "The primary workflow benefit is freeing up both hands to direct the client and build rapport.",
    "Always choose a tripod that can extend higher than your tallest subject."
