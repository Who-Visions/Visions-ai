  "key_takeaways": [
    "A 'test shoot' is for portfolio building; ensure the model, photographer, and agent all benefit.",
    "Agents often prefer simple, clean images ('front of book' shots) that show the model naturally.",
    "Black and white processing helps focus attention on the subject's connection and emotion.",
    "A white beauty dish is a versatile modifier that is flattering but provides good contrast.",
    "Adding a grid to a light source restricts the spill, allowing you to turn a white wall into a dark gray background for drama.",
    "Simple adjustments to light placement (feathering) can drastically change the mood without adding more gear."
