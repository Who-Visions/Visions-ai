    "title": "Meta-Prompting Workflow: Automating Prompt Engineering with OpenAI O1 & O1 Pro",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates 'Meta-Prompting,' a technique where a master XML-based prompt is used to generate highly structured, task-specific prompts for various use cases (Data Analysis, Debugging, Content Creation). The process compares the execution speed and quality between OpenAI's O1 and O1 Pro models, utilizing external CLI tools for data preparation.",

        "Meta-prompting unlocks asymmetric productivity by allowing a single master prompt to generate infinite specialized, high-quality prompts.",
        "XML structure is the optimal format for complex prompt engineering, allowing for clear separation of instructions, examples, and data.",
        "OpenAI O1 is significantly faster (often seconds vs minutes) than O1 Pro for both prompt generation and execution, though O1 Pro offers marginally better detail.",
        "Effective agentic workflows require external tools (like jq or custom scripts) to manage context window limitations when dealing with large datasets."
