    "title": "Gemini 3 Pro & Agent Sandboxes: Scaling Compute with Reprogrammed Agents",
    "summary": "This tutorial explores the release of Gemini 3 Pro and demonstrates a shift from focusing solely on model benchmarks to building robust agentic workflows. The presenter shows how to 'reprogram' agents using custom backslash commands and shared skills to give them their own isolated computing environments (sandboxes) via E2B. By running multiple agents (Gemini, Claude, Codex) in parallel on full-stack engineering tasks, the video illustrates the 'Best of N' strategy—scaling impact by throwing compute at problems and selecting the best results.",
