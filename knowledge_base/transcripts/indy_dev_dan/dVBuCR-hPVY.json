    "title": "Indie Hacker Runway Strategies & Resource Management",
    "summary": "A strategic analysis of resource management for indie hackers, focusing on the relationship between 'Runway', 'Burn', and 'Time To Build'. The workflow utilizes Mermaid.live to visualize and evaluate seven distinct lifestyle strategies for funding and building software products, culminating in the 'Endgame' of self-sustaining profitability.",

        "Runway is a function of Cash divided by Burn, but 'Time To Build' is the actual constraint on progress.",
        "The 'Endgame' is reached when Product Profit > Personal Burn, removing the need for external funding strategies.",
        "Strategies vary by risk and time availability; 'Do it all' offers stability but low speed, while 'All In, All Out' offers speed but lower stability."
