    "title": "Talk To Your Database: Agentic SQL Analytics Workflow",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates the capabilities of 'Talk To Your Database,' an agentic AI tool that converts natural language into complex SQL queries. It covers the end-to-end process from connecting to a PostgreSQL database, executing multi-agent query generation, verifying results with external tools, and managing security through automated data expiration and stop-word filtering.",
