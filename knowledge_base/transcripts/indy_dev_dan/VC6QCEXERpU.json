    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates a practical approach to evaluating Small Language Models (SLMs) like Llama 3.2, Phi 3.5, and Qwen 2.5 against larger cloud models. Using a custom Marimo notebook and Ollama, the process involves side-by-side comparisons across various domains—coding, SQL generation, summarization, and context handling—to determine the readiness of local models for specific engineering workflows.",
