    "title": "Agentic Drop Zones: Automating File-Based Workflows",
    "summary": "This tutorial introduces 'Agentic Drop Zones' (ADZ), a framework that shifts Generative AI interaction from chat boxes to file system events. By running a single Python script (`adz`), users can drag and drop files into configured directories to trigger specialized agentic workflows—such as image generation, financial analysis, and data expansion—powered by agents like Claude Code and Gemini. The system relies on a `drops.yaml` configuration file and reusable Markdown prompts to orchestrate end-to-end automation.",
