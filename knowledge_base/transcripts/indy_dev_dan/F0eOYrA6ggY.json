    "title": "Building an Autonomous Agentic Workflow for Live Data Updates",
    "summary": "This tutorial demonstrates how to evolve from simple prompt chains to a fully autonomous 'Agentic Workflow'. The presenter builds a system that automatically triggers, scrapes web data (LLM pricing), processes it using an LLM, detects changes, updates a live dataset, and sends push notifications to a mobile device without human intervention.",

            "time": "00:03:29",
            "action": "Trigger: Schedule the workflow loop",
            "tool": "Python `schedule` library",
            "reasoning": "Establishes the heartbeat of the agent, allowing it to run autonomously at set intervals (e.g., every minute) without manual initiation."

            "action": "Retrieve: Scrape external pricing pages",
            "tool": "Python / Web Scraping",
            "reasoning": "The agent gathers fresh context from the real world (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google sites) to inform its decisions."

            "tool": "Claude 3.5 Sonnet / `MinimalChainable`",
            "reasoning": "Uses SOTA LLMs to parse unstructured web data into structured JSON, acting as the cognitive engine of the workflow."

            "tool": "Python (`detect_model_changes`)",
            "reasoning": "The agent evaluates if the new information differs from the old state. If significant, it autonomously updates the production dataset (`model-pricing.json`)."

            "action": "Act: Commit and Push Code",
            "tool": "Git (`git commit`, `git push`)",
            "reasoning": "Demonstrates the agent's ability to modify the codebase or content repository directly, treating infrastructure as something it can manipulate."

    "key_takeaways": [
        "The 'TRAALN' Framework: Trigger, Retrieve, Agentics, Act, Learn, Notify is the blueprint for autonomous workflows.",
        "LLMs should be treated as functions (String In, String Out) to integrate seamlessly into code logic.",
        "Start with SOTA models (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for reliability, then optimize for cost later.",
        "Effective logging and push notifications are critical for debugging and trusting background agents.",
        "The goal of agentic workflows is to write software that performs valuable work (like updating data) while the human sleeps."
