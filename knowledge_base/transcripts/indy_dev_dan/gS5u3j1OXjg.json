    "key_takeaways": [
        "The 'Fisherman's Prompt' transforms generic LLM interactions into a structured, chapter-based educational course.",
        "Defining rules (e.g., 'one chapter at a time', 'ask for feedback') prevents information overload and ensures pacing.",
        "Interactive querying allows the user to control the depth of learning, pausing to deconstruct complex syntax or concepts.",
        "The workflow supports dynamic curriculum expansion, linking code libraries (Pytest) to broader engineering practices (CI/CD)."
