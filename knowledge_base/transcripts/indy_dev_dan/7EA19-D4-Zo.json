    "title": "Rapid Multi-Framework Front-End Development with Aider and Triple C",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates the 'Triple C' (Comment Copilot Coding) technique to build a Postgres data analytics front-end simultaneously in Vue, Svelte, and React. By embedding natural language instructions as comments directly into source files, the engineer directs the Aider AI agent to generate UI components, state management logic, and API integrations. The process highlights how to act as a high-level architect while an AI agent handles implementation details across familiar and unfamiliar frameworks.",

        "The 'Triple C' technique allows engineers to architect functionality via comments while delegating syntax implementation to AI agents.",
        "Aider enables parallel development in unfamiliar frameworks (e.g., learning Svelte on the fly) by abstracting syntax differences.",
        "AI Agents require supervision; they may overwrite context or misplace code blocks, necessitating a review-and-refine loop.",
        "Iterative prompting is effective for debugging specific framework behaviors (like reactivity) without deep prior knowledge."
