  "title": "Building Agent Experts: Self-Improving AI Workflows",
  "summary": "This lesson distinguishes between generic agents that forget context and 'Agent Experts' that learn and retain expertise over time. It introduces 'Meta Agentics'—using prompts, agents, and skills to build other agents—and demonstrates how to create specialized experts (e.g., Database, WebSocket) that maintain a persistent 'Mental Model' (expertise file). These experts execute tasks using a 'Plan, Build, Improve' workflow, automatically updating their own knowledge base to stay synchronized with the codebase.",

    "The codebase is the only source of truth; the Mental Model is a reference used to validate understanding against the code.",
    "The 'Self-Improve' step is essential for automation, allowing agents to update their own documentation and understanding without human intervention."
