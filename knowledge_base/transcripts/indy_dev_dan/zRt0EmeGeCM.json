    "summary": "This workflow analyzes the paradigm shift caused by Gemini 1.5's 1M token context window and OpenAI's Sora, suggesting that traditional RAG may be obsolete. It transitions into a practical tutorial on 'IndyDevTools', a CLI framework for building autonomous, reusable AI agents to automate developer workflows like YouTube metadata generation.",
