    "title": "AI Programming Learning HTMX With Aider",
    "summary": "A developer utilizes the Aider AI coding assistant to rapidly prototype a full-stack Python Flask application integrated with HTMX. The workflow demonstrates an agentic approach by first establishing context via documentation injection, generating scaffolding for backend and frontend, and then iteratively refining specific HTMX patterns (AJAX, polling, animations, search, and loading states) through natural language commands.",
