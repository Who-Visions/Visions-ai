        "Autonomy acts as a multiplier for Compute Scaling, having a disproportionate impact on the final Compute Advantage score compared to linear cost reductions.",

        "The shift from manual coding to agentic workflows is defined by maximizing 'Compute Advantage' rather than just minimizing direct costs."
