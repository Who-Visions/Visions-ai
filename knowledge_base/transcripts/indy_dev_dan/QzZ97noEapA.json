    "title": "Agentic Coding: Orchestrating AIDER via Claude Code and MCP",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates a hybrid agentic pattern where Claude Code acts as the high-level orchestrator and reviewer, while delegating specific coding tasks to AIDER via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). By configuring AIDER to use cost-effective or high-intelligence models (like Gemini 2.5 Pro or Quasar Alpha), the user optimizes for both cost and control, establishing a 'Looping Editor-Reviewer' workflow where Claude plans and validates, and AIDER executes.",

    "key_takeaways": [
        "The 'Editor-Reviewer' workflow allows Claude Code to act as an architect while AIDER handles the raw coding.",
        "Using MCP allows for delegating expensive token generation to cheaper, high-performance models like Gemini 2.5 Pro.",
        "Agentic coding is about combining tools (AND logic) rather than selecting a single tool (OR logic).",
        "Claude Code validates AIDER's work, ensuring quality control remains with the more intelligent orchestrator.",
        "The Compute Advantage Equation relies on increasing autonomy and compute scaling to reduce human time and effort."
