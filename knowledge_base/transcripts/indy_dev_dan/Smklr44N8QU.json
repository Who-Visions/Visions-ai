    "title": "Accelerated Development with Cursor Copilot++: Building a Vue Flow Graph Editor",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates the agentic capabilities of Cursor's Copilot++ by building an interactive node graph application. It showcases the transition from manual coding to high-level prompting, utilizing features like multi-line auto-completion, context-aware inline edits, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for library-specific documentation to rapidly prototype and refine complex UI and logic.",

        "Copilot++ enables 'tab-driven development' by predicting entire logic blocks and context-aware changes, reducing manual typing.",
        "Effective agentic workflows require iterative prompting and active human oversight to catch logic errors (e.g., accidental code deletion).",
        "Indexing external documentation (@docs) is crucial for enabling the AI to correctly implement syntax for specific third-party libraries.",
        "The developer's role shifts from writing syntax to defining high-level logic, UX requirements, and reviewing AI-generated implementation."
