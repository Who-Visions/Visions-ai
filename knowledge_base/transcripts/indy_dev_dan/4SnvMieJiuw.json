    "title": "Engineering in 2025: AI Agentic Workflows & Tooling",
    "summary": "A strategic overview and technical demonstration of leveraging next-generation AI tooling to transform software engineering. The video showcases 'Ada', a personal AI assistant powered by Realtime API and o1 Reasoning, performing end-to-end database operations via voice commands. It further outlines a framework for maximizing productivity by moving tasks up the 'AI composition chain'—from simple prompts to autonomous agentic software—transforming engineers into 'Commanders of Compute'.",
