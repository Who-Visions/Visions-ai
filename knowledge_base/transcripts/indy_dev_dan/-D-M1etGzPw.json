    "title": "Building TypeScript CLI Tools with AI Coding Assistants",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates the iterative process of building and testing a TypeScript CLI application using AI coding assistants. It contrasts the capabilities of tools like Cursor and Aider against a set of standards for 'true' AI assistants, while addressing critical challenges such as file context management, accuracy, and skill atrophy.",

    "key_takeaways": [
        "True AI Coding Assistants must support CRUD operations on existing codebases, maintain file context, and allow iterative control.",
        "The prompt is becoming the new fundamental unit of programming.",
        "Current AI coding challenges include File Management, Accuracy, Speed, Security, and Skill Atrophy.",
        "Tools like Cursor and Aider are currently leading the market by solving context and iterative control better than generic chat interfaces.",
        "To prevent skill atrophy, developers must pay close attention to prompt results and treat the AI workflow as a collaboration rather than automation."
