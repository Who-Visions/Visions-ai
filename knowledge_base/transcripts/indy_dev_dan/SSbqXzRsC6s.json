    "title": "Optimizing Agentic Workflows with the Weak-Base-Strong Model Stack",
    "summary": "A strategic workflow for orchestrating multi-agent systems by leveraging a tiered model stack (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus). This approach optimizes for performance, speed, and cost while mitigating API rate limits. The process involves running parallel sub-agents with distinct compute levels to perform comprehensive research, analyzing execution metrics to avoid model overkill, and refining agent configurations to ensure the right level of intelligence is applied to each specific task.",

        "Define custom agents via structured Markdown files to enforce specific model usage and output formats, preventing 'model drift'.",
        "Prioritize performance over speed for critical analysis; 'Thinking' models (Sonnet Think/Opus Think) significantly outperform base models for complex logic."
