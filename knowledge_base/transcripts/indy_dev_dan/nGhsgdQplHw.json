    "title": "Claude Code 2.0 AGENTIC Coding",
    "summary": "A demonstration of advanced agentic engineering workflows using Claude Code and Sonnet 4.5. The video contrasts standard coding tools with a 'Tactical Agentic Coding' approach, showcasing two primary workflows: an autonomous 'AFK' agent loop for prototyping on a dedicated device, and a local 'Scout, Plan, Build' workflow for a complex SDK migration. The core strategy involves encoding engineering processes into reusable custom slash commands and delegating context-heavy tasks to specialized sub-agents.",

    "key_takeaways": [
        "**Scout-Plan-Build Framework**: Breaking engineering tasks into distinct phases allows for better error handling and context management compared to a single long prompt.",
        "**Context Economy via Delegation**: Offloading 'scouting' (searching files) to cheaper, faster models prevents the main 'Planner' agent's context window from filling up with irrelevant data.",
        "**Encoded Engineering**: Best practices can be captured in reusable Custom Slash Commands, effectively 'building systems that build systems'.",
        "**The Stakeholder Trifecta**: Structured workflows (like explicit Plans) serve three audiences: You (the engineer), Your Team (for review), and Your Agents (for execution context)."
