    "title": "Fine-Tuning GPT-4o for Automated Image Prompt Expansion",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates how to fine-tune OpenAI's GPT-4o to create a 'Vision Grid' application. The process involves training a model to act as an 'expansion prompt' engine, converting short user inputs into highly detailed image generation prompts. These expanded prompts are then fed into Black Forest Labs' Flux models via the Replicate API. The tutorial covers the strategic reasoning for fine-tuning (consistency, token reduction, and specific formatting) and provides a Python-based CLI workflow for managing the OpenAI fine-tuning lifecycle.",

        "Fine-tuning acts as an 'Expansion Prompt' mechanism, turning low-fidelity user input into high-fidelity system instructions.",
        "A primary justification for fine-tuning is massive token reduction (e.g., removing 14k token instructions) compared to few-shot prompting.",
        "Fine-tuning should be considered a 'last resort' optimization after standard prompt engineering and chaining fail to yield consistent results.",
        "Combining fine-tuned LLMs with specialized generation models (like Flux) creates powerful, leveraged agentic workflows."
