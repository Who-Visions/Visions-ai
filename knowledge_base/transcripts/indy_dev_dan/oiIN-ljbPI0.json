    "title": "Building a Visual AI Agent Network: From Prototype to Functional VueGPT",
    "summary": "The video details the development of an 'Agent Network' application, evolving from a visual prototype (V1) to a functional tool (V2) capable of integrating real AI agents. It demonstrates how to visualize, configure, and execute LLM-based tasks—specifically generating Vue.js components—by abstracting backend complexity into modular, interconnected nodes using Nuxt, Cytoscape, and Redis.",
