    "summary": "A strategic workflow for evaluating the trade-offs between speed, cost, and correctness in LLMs using a custom reactive benchmarking tool. The process involves real-time autocomplete generation, human-in-the-loop validation, and dynamic prompt engineering to assess model viability for developer tooling.",

        "Claude 3.5 Sonnet remains the 'King of Quality' with 100% correctness in this benchmark, justifying its higher price point.",
        "Reactive, custom benchmarking tools are superior to static leaderboards for understanding specific use-case performance (e.g., single-word completion)."
