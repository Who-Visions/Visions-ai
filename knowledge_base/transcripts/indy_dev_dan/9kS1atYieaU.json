    "title": "Engineering Multi-Agent Systems: YouTube Metadata Automation",
    "summary": "This tutorial outlines a strategic approach to building multi-agent systems using the P5 Pyramid Framework (Principles, Plan, POC, POV, Future). It demonstrates a practical Proof of Concept by automating YouTube metadata generation. The workflow integrates deterministic code (for transcription and image resizing) with LLM agents (for creative generation), emphasizing modular architecture where 'everything is a function' to create reusable, testable building blocks.",
