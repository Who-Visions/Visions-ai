    "title": "Building Reliable Domain-Specific Agents with OpenAI Structured Outputs",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates how to leverage OpenAI's Structured Outputs update to build highly reliable, domain-specific AI agents. By using Pydantic models to define strict schemas for function calling, the tutorial showcases an image processing agent that generates, converts, and resizes images with 100% schema adherence, eliminating previous reliability issues with tool calling.",

            "tool": "Pydantic / Zod",
            "reasoning": "Wrapping function parameters in Pydantic objects guarantees the LLM responds in the exact format required for execution, ensuring 100% reliability."

            "tool": "Python Enum",
            "reasoning": "Using Enums (like ImageRatio) narrows down the AI's choices to pre-defined valid values, preventing hallucinations or invalid parameter generation."

            "tool": "GenerateImageParams / DALL-E 3",
            "reasoning": "The agent translates natural language requests into structured parameters (prompts, quality, ratio) to trigger image generation."

            "reasoning": "A `tool_function_map` connects the LLM's structured decision (tool name) to the actual Python logic, closing the loop between intent and action."

    "key_takeaways": [
        "Structured Outputs provide 100% guaranteed schema adherence for function calling, solving previous reliability issues.",
        "Using Enums in data models restricts AI hallucinations and ensures valid parameter selection for critical functions.",
        "Building narrow, domain-specific agents (e.g., image modification) is currently more effective than broad, generic assistants.",
        "The update includes significant cost reductions (50% input, 33% output) for GPT-4o, making agentic workflows more affordable."
