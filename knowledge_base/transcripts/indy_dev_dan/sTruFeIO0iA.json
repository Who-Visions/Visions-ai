    "title": "Two-Way Prompting: Human-in-the-Loop Agentic Workflows",
    "summary": "A demonstration of the 'Two-Way Prompt' methodology, which transforms standard one-way agent interactions into collaborative workflows. By treating the human user as a critical node, the AI agent proactively requests missing context (URLs, files, preferences) and iterates based on feedback. This approach utilizes temporary files and system dialogs to facilitate rich, multi-step communication between the engineer and the AI assistant (ADA).",
