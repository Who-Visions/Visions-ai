  "title": "Elite Context Engineering: The R&D Framework for Claude Code Agents",
  "summary": "This workflow details the 'Reduce and Delegate' (R&D) framework for optimizing AI agent performance. It progresses from beginner techniques—such as eliminating unused MCP servers and static memory files—to advanced agentic strategies like context priming, sub-agent delegation, and background processing to manage the context window effectively.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "time": "02:14:000",
      "action": "Delete default .mcp.json and strictly load only necessary MCP servers",
      "tool": "Claude Code CLI (--mcp-config)",
      "reasoning": "Unused MCP tools can consume significant context (e.g., 12%) and distract the agent. Explicit loading reduces token waste."
    },
    {
      "time": "05:30:000",
      "action": "Replace large CLAUDE.md with CLAUDE.concise.md",
      "tool": "Markdown / File System",
      "reasoning": "Large, static memory files are always loaded, reducing dynamic context space. A concise file ensures only universal essentials are present."
    },
    {
      "time": "06:40:000",
      "action": "Implement Context Priming via custom slash commands (e.g., /prime)",
      "tool": "Custom Slash Commands (.md files)",
      "reasoning": "Priming allows the user to inject specific, relevant context for a task (bug, feature, chore) rather than relying on a generic global context."
    },
    {
      "time": "10:25:000",
      "action": "Deploy Sub-Agents for specific tasks (e.g., docs-scraper)",
      "tool": "Claude Code Sub-Agents",
      "reasoning": "Sub-agents use system prompts and operate on a forked context. Their token consumption does not pollute the primary agent's context window (Delegation)."
    },
    {
      "time": "15:05:000",
      "action": "Utilize Context Bundles to save and reload agent execution states",
      "tool": "JSONL Context Bundles (/load_bundle)",
      "reasoning": "Context bundles provide a concise, append-only log of agent work, enabling state replay and efficient context management for complex workflows."
    },
    {
      "time": "16:45:000",
      "action": "Execute full agent instances in the background",
      "tool": "Claude Code Background Command (/background)",
      "reasoning": "Delegates entire workflows to a secondary agent instance, freeing the primary interface for parallel work and enabling out-loop agentic coding."
    }
  ],
  "key_takeaways": [
    "A focused agent is a performant agent; performance degrades as the context window fills due to LLM scaling laws.",
    "The R&D Framework (Reduce and Delegate) is the core strategy for managing context windows.",
    "Avoid 'always-on' context bloat like unused MCP servers or massive CLAUDE.md files.",
    "Use Context Priming to dynamically load only the context needed for the specific task at hand.",
    "Delegate heavy context tasks to sub-agents or background processes to keep the primary agent lightweight."
