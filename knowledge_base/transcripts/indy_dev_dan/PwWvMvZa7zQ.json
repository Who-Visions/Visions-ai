    "title": "Advanced Prompt Engineering for Front-End Component Generation",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates a structured approach to generating complex front-end components using Large Language Models. By utilizing a four-part prompting framework (Role, Purpose, Requirements, Memory), the user generates a Vue.js Carousel component and subsequently refines the code through iterative debugging and CSS adjustments to achieve a functional result.",

        "The 'Role, Purpose, Requirements, Memory' framework is a reusable template for high-fidelity code generation.",
        "Providing 'Memory' (existing code snippets or syntax examples) is crucial for guiding LLMs to use specific versions or patterns.",
        "AI-generated code typically achieves 80-90% completion, requiring a human-in-the-loop for final debugging and logic refinement."
