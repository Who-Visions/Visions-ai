    "title": "Scaling Engineering with Codex and Claude Code Agentic Workflows",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates a hybrid approach to agentic coding, utilizing OpenAI's Codex for high-level, parallel background tasks (planning, bug fixing, testing) and Anthropic's Claude Code for granular, high-control terminal operations. The process emphasizes scaling compute by running multiple agentic loops simultaneously and managing the trade-off between control (terminal) and ease of use (web agents).",
