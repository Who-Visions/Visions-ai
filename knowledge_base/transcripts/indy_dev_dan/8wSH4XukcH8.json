    "title": "Agent OS: A Micro-Architecture for AI Agents",
    "summary": "A comprehensive framework for architecting AI agents by decomposing them into three functional units: LPU (Language Processing Unit), I/O (Input/Output), and RAM (State). This approach emphasizes modularity, composability, and the separation of logic from state to create scalable and interoperable agentic workflows.",

        "The Agent OS architecture splits agents into LPU (Logic), I/O (Tools/Monitoring), and RAM (State).",
        "Composability is the next level of abstraction, treating agents as modular functions to build complex workflows.",
        "Separating RAM (State) from the LPU allows for explicit state management and autonomous operation.",
        "Monitoring ('Spyware') is crucial; if you cannot measure the agent's internal state and outputs, you cannot improve it.",
        "The architecture prioritizes modularity, enabling the rapid swapping of underlying models (e.g., GPT-4 to GPT-5) without refactoring."
