    "title": "Local LLM Workflow with Llamafile and Bash Automation",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates how to deploy and automate local Large Language Models (LLMs) using Mozilla's llamafile. The process moves from downloading single-file executables to running them via CLI and Server modes. It culminates in creating a reusable Bash function ('lllm')—assisted by the AI coding tool AIDER—that dynamically routes prompts to different models (Mistral for chat, WizardCoder for code) and integrates the workflow into the system shell for global access.",
