    "title": "Building a Personal AI Assistant: The PAR Framework & Keyword Routing",
    "summary": "This tutorial demonstrates the creation of 'ADA', a proof-of-concept personal AI assistant. It introduces the PAR (Prompt, Agent, Response) framework as a continuous loop for handling user interactions. The system utilizes a Simple Keyword AI Agent Router to deterministically direct voice commands to specific Python functions (agents) for tasks like answering questions, controlling the browser, or generating shell commands. The video also critiques the current architecture, highlighting latency issues with STT/TTS and the need for future improvements in event-driven audio processing.",
