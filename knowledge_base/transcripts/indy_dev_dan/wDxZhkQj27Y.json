    "title": "3 Concrete Instant Value Practical Prompt Engineering Techniques",
    "summary": "A practical guide focusing on efficient prompt engineering techniques to maximize LLM utility while minimizing user effort. The tutorial critiques over-hyped AI frameworks and introduces three core methods—Capitalized Referencing, One Word Prompts, and Context Chaining—demonstrating how to structure inputs for clarity, speed, and context density.",
    "steps": [
        {
            "time": "00:59",
            "action": "Implement Capitalized Referencing (Cap Refs) by defining input variables in all caps (e.g., EXISTING_TITLES) and referencing them in the prompt instructions.",
            "tool": "ChatGPT / LLM",
            "reasoning": "Separates instructions from data, allowing for reusable prompts where the LLM can clearly distinguish between the task and the input variables."
        },
        {
            "time": "02:20",
            "action": "Use One Word Prompts (e.g., 'pytest', 'translate', 'reword') followed immediately by the code or text block.",
            "tool": "ChatGPT / LLM",
            "reasoning": "Leverages the LLM's ability to infer intent from a single keyword, drastically reducing typing time and avoiding over-engineered instructions for standard tasks."
        },
        {
            "time": "05:28",
            "action": "Apply Context Chaining by listing keywords separated by colons (e.g., 'code: python: poetry: publish to testpypi') instead of writing full sentences.",
            "tool": "ChatGPT / LLM",
            "reasoning": "Compresses the prompt length (e.g., from 148 to 41 characters) while providing sufficient semantic context for the LLM to retrieve the correct knowledge."
        },
        {
            "time": "08:25",
            "action": "Combine Context Chaining with Cap Refs (e.g., 'code: python: combine FUNC1 and FUNC2') to perform complex operations on specific data blocks.",
            "tool": "ChatGPT / LLM",
            "reasoning": "Synthesizes the brevity of context chaining with the structural clarity of capitalized references to handle complex tasks like code merging efficiently."
        }
    ],
    "key_takeaways": [
        "Avoid over-hyped AI agent frameworks and focus on fundamental prompt engineering skills.",
        "Capitalized Referencing acts as variable declaration, making prompts modular and easier to organize.",
        "One Word Prompts save time by stripping away conversational filler, resulting in blunt but effective outputs.",
        "Context Chaining allows for high-density information transfer, reducing token usage and typing effort.",
        "The better LLMs become, the less verbose instruction they need; specifying the right context is more important than length."
