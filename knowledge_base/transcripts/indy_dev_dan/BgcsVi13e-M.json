    "title": "Building a Persistent Agent Network with Nuxt 3 and Vercel KV",
    "summary": "This tutorial outlines the creation of an interactive Agent Network visualization. It demonstrates a full-stack workflow using Nuxt 3 for the application framework, Cytoscape.js for rendering complex graph relationships between agents, and Vercel KV for persisting the network state. The process moves from scaffolding the environment to defining strict TypeScript data models, implementing reactive graph logic, and finally establishing server-side storage for agent memory.",
