    "title": "Fusion Chain and Evaluator Patterns in Agentic Workflows",
    "summary": "This workflow details the evolution from linear 'Prompt Chaining' to 'Fusion Chaining' (also known as Beam or Competition Chains). The core strategy involves running parallel inference across multiple state-of-the-art models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) for the same task. A programmatic 'Evaluator' then scores and merges these outputs to select the optimal result. The concept is demonstrated via 'Zero Noise,' an application that uses this workflow to autonomously learn and verify HTML selectors for web scraping.",

    "key_takeaways": [
        "The 'Evaluator' is the most critical pattern for autonomous agents, as it allows the system to judge its own outputs and self-improve without human intervention.",
        "Fusion Chaining (Multi-Chain) outperforms single-model chains by leveraging the 'wisdom of the crowd' across different model architectures (OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. Google).",
        "Staying 'close to the metal' (avoiding heavy abstraction libraries like LangChain initially) is recommended to fully understand and optimize the flow of data and prompts.",
        "Agentic workflows are not just linear sequences; they are graph-like structures that can loop, branch, and compete to maximize accuracy."
