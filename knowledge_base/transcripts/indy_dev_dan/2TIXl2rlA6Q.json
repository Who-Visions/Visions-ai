    "title": "Programmable Agentic Coding: Scaling Engineering with Claude Code",
    "summary": "This tutorial explores the transition from AI Coding to Agentic Coding using Claude Code. It demonstrates how to leverage Claude Code's programmable CLI and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to build autonomous workflows. By embedding Claude Code into Bash and Python scripts, the workflow illustrates scaling compute to automate complex engineering tasks, from simple file creation to full application scaffolding and Notion-driven task execution.",

    "key_takeaways": [
        "Agentic Coding differs from AI Coding by allowing access to arbitrary tools (Bash, MCP) rather than just code generation.",
        "Claude Code is 'infinitely programmable' and can be embedded inside scripts (Bash, Python) to scale engineering compute.",
        "Scaling compute usage is directly correlated with scaling engineering impact and success.",
        "Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers allow agents to extend their capabilities to any external tool or API (e.g., Notion).",
        "Great planning is great prompting; structuring tasks in external systems like Notion can drive autonomous agent execution."
