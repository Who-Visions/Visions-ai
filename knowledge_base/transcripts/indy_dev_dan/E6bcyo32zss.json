    "title": "The One Billion Row Challenge: Electron & AI Edition",
    "summary": "This tutorial demonstrates a modern, AI-accelerated workflow to solve the 'One Billion Row Challenge' by building a high-performance desktop application. The workflow utilizes Electron for the frontend and DuckDB for the data engine. Key to the process is the use of AI tools (Cursor, Aider, and OpenAI Assistants API) to rapidly scaffold the UI, establish secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC), and generate optimized SQL and TypeScript logic by ingesting external documentation into a knowledge base.",
