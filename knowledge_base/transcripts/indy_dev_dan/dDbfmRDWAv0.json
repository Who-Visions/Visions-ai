    "title": "Gemini 2.0 Flash vs Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Aider Architect Mode Workflow",
    "summary": "A comparative analysis of using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Claude 3.5 Sonnet within Aider's 'Architect Mode' to implement new features in a Personal Knowledge Base. The workflow utilizes a structured 'Spec Prompt' to guide the AI agents through drafting and editing code, followed by a rigorous evaluation of speed, cost, and accuracy.",
