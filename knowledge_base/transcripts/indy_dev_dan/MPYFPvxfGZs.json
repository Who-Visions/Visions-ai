    "title": "Agentic Coding with Aider: Building a Vue.js App via CLI",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates the capabilities of Aider, a command-line AI coding assistant, to build and modify a Vue.js application. By leveraging GPT-4 directly in the terminal, the process illustrates how to manage file context, issue natural language instructions for code generation, and utilize automated Git integration to develop software without manual coding.",

    "key_takeaways": [
        "Zero-Context Switching: Aider integrates directly into the terminal, keeping the developer in the flow.",
        "Context Management: Explicitly adding files allows the agent to understand the codebase without overloading the context window.",
        "Automated Git Ops: The agent handles commits automatically, creating a granular history of AI-generated changes.",
        "Iterative Prompting: Success relies on a cycle of instruction, observation, and refinement rather than a single perfect prompt.",
        "Token Economy: Active management of chat history is required to keep the agent efficient and cost-effective."
