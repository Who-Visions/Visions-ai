    "title": "Building a Serverless Vue.js Composable Generator with Google Cloud and OpenAI",
    "summary": "This workflow details the creation of a developer productivity tool that generates Vue.js composable functions using a Python-based Google Cloud Function and the OpenAI API. The process moves from local environment setup and dependency management to implementing the LLM logic with prompt engineering, testing locally using the Functions Framework, deploying to production, and finally creating a Bash alias for seamless CLI usage.",

        "Using `functions-framework` allows for accurate local simulation of serverless environments, speeding up the feedback loop.",
        "Few-shot prompting (providing a `PROMPT_EXAMPLE`) is critical for guiding LLMs to produce specific coding patterns like Vue composables.",
        "Wrapping API endpoints in Bash aliases transforms a remote serverless function into a native-feeling CLI tool.",
        "Separating configuration (YAML files) from logic ensures secure and flexible deployments across different environments."
