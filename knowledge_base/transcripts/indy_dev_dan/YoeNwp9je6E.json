    "title": "Local Reasoning & Extraction Workflow with QwQ",
    "summary": "A strategic workflow designed to utilize Alibaba's QwQ local reasoning model while mitigating its primary flaw of 'entangled output' (mixing internal thoughts with final answers). The process employs a two-step prompt chain: first leveraging QwQ for deep reasoning and content generation, then passing that raw output to a standard base model (Qwen 2.5) to extract and format the final deliverable into clean JSON.",

    "key_takeaways": [
        "QwQ is a powerful local reasoning model but suffers from 'entangled output,' where Chain of Thought (CoT) is mixed with the final answer.",
        "The 'Reasoning -> Extraction' pattern solves the CoT issue by using a second model solely for formatting and parsing.",
        "Prompt chaining allows local devices to emulate the behavior of advanced proprietary models like o1 by separating generation from formatting.",
        "Adding specific language prefixes (e.g., 'ENGLISH:') is currently necessary to stabilize QwQ's output language."
