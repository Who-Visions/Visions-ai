    "title": "Cost-Effective Agentic Workflows: The GPT-4o Mini Fusion Chain Pattern",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates how to leverage the low cost of GPT-4o mini to achieve state-of-the-art results using a 'Fusion Chain' architecture. By running multiple parallel prompt chains and merging them with an evaluator function, the system filters noise and recommends relevant content within the 'Zero Noise' application. The workflow includes a feedback loop where user interactions refine future agentic decisions.",

        "The 'Fusion Chain' pattern allows developers to replace expensive state-of-the-art models with multiple parallel instances of cheaper models (like GPT-4o mini) without sacrificing result quality.",
        "Agentic workflows should include a feedback loop (Memory) where user interactions (thumbs up/down) directly modify the configuration, allowing the agent to learn and refine its filtering logic over time.",
        "Prompt Chaining breaks complex tasks into steps (Extraction -> Filtering), allowing the LLM to 'reason' more effectively than a single zero-shot prompt."
