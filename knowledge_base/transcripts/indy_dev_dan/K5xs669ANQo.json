    "title": "Mastering o3-mini: A 3-Step Framework for Evaluating Reasoning Models",
    "summary": "This tutorial introduces a rigorous three-step framework (Vibe Check, Compare, Eval) for evaluating the new OpenAI o3-mini model against competitors like DeepSeek-R1 and o1. Using a real-world engineering task—extracting structured financial data from Meta's Q4 2024 earnings report—the video demonstrates how to move from manual testing to automated benchmarking to objectively assess accuracy, latency, and cost.",

    "key_takeaways": [
        "o3-mini provides o1-level intelligence at approximately 1/8th the cost and significantly higher speeds.",
        "The 'Vibe, Compare, Eval' framework moves engineering from subjective impressions to objective, data-driven model selection.",
        "o3-mini-high demonstrated 96.67% accuracy on the financial extraction task, saturating the benchmark.",
        "Reasoning effort (low, medium, high) in o3-mini allows developers to trade off cost and speed without necessarily sacrificing accuracy for simpler extraction tasks."
