    "title": "MCP Maxxing: Building Agentic Workflows with Prompts",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates 'MCP Maxxing,' a strategy to elevate AI engineering from simple tool calling to full agentic workflows using Model Context Protocol (MCP) Prompts. By utilizing the 'quick-data' MCP server within Claude Code, the tutorial illustrates how Prompts serve as the highest-leverage primitive—superior to Tools and Resources—by guiding agents through discovery, data loading, complex analysis, and visualization without leaving the terminal.",
