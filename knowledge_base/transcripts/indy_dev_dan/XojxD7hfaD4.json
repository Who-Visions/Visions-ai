        "Complexity should be earned, not assumed; start with ad-hoc prompts and scale only when friction arises.",

        "Use Sub-Agents specifically when tasks require parallelization and distinct domain expertise.",
        "MCP Wrappers are essential for encapsulating logic and exposing unique assets to multiple agent types."
