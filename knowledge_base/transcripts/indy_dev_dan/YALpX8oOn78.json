    "summary": "A demonstration of an agentic coding workflow using Cursor and Aider to build, refactor, and test a TypeScript CLI application. The process highlights the transition from manual coding to high-level prompting, showcasing how AI tools handle boilerplate, error fixing, multi-file refactoring, and test generation to significantly multiply developer productivity.",

        "AI coding assistants can provide an estimated 8x productivity multiplier by converting short prompts into hundreds of lines of functional code.",
        "Effective agentic workflows involve switching tools based on strength: Cursor for rapid iteration/prediction and Aider for complex multi-file refactoring.",
        "The role of the engineer shifts from writing syntax to defining 'what to do' while the AI handles 'how to do it'.",
        "Multi-file context and editing capabilities are essential for moving beyond simple snippets to maintaining real-world codebases."
