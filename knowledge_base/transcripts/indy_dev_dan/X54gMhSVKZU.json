    "summary": "This workflow constructs a 'Human-in-the-loop' agentic system where AI generates content drafts into a Notion database. A human reviews these drafts (Approve/Reject), and a serverless Python application automates the maintenance (deleting rejections) and publishing (posting approvals) via scheduled cron jobs, effectively using Notion as a shared state between the AI agent and the human user.",

        "The 'Human-in-the-Loop' architecture mitigates AI hallucination risks by enforcing an approval step before external actions (posting) occur."
