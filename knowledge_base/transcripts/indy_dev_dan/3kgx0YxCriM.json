    "summary": "A deep dive into using Claude Opus 4.5 for advanced agentic engineering, demonstrating how to delegate complex tasks to subagents, orchestrate parallel browser automation, and build full-stack applications using isolated agent sandboxes.",

            "action": "Configure CLI aliases for specific Claude models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus)",
            "tool": "Terminal / Bash",
            "reasoning": "Streamlines the workflow by allowing rapid switching between models based on task complexity and cost requirements."

            "tool": "Claude Code CLI / generic-browser-test",
            "reasoning": "Demonstrates 'Enhanced Agent Delegation' where a primary agent spawns multiple subagents to perform parallel tasks (downloading, summarizing, screenshotting) significantly faster than a single serial agent."

            "tool": "Claude Code CLI / fork terminal",
            "reasoning": "Allows the engineer to multitask by handing off a long-running orchestration task (listing and opening sandboxes) to a separate agent process while keeping the main terminal free."

    "key_takeaways": [
        "Opus 4.5 enables 'Enhanced Agent Delegation', allowing a primary agent to effectively manage a team of subagents for parallel task execution.",
        "Agent Sandboxes provide the necessary isolation, scale, and autonomy for agents to build and test full-stack applications safely.",
        "The engineering paradigm is shifting from writing code to orchestrating agents via 'Plan, Build, Host, Test' workflows.",
        "Premium compute costs are offset by the efficiency of one-shotting complex tasks and reducing the total number of tool calls required."
