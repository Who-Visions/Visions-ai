    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates how to accelerate Vue.js development by utilizing custom VS Code snippets. It covers the end-to-end process of scaffolding a Vite project, generating component boilerplate, creating reactive composables with lifecycle hooks, and consuming them efficiently to minimize repetitive coding tasks.",

    "key_takeaways": [
        "Using short-hand snippets (e.g., 'vuebn', 'hkk', 'reff') significantly reduces development time by automating boilerplate code.",
        "Advanced snippets can leverage context, such as using the current filename to auto-populate CSS class names.",
        "Snippets facilitate better coding standards by ensuring consistent structures for Composables, Refs, and Lifecycle hooks across the project."
