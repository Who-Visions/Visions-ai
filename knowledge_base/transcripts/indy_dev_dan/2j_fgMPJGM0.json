    "title": "Mastering AI Coding Tools: Copilots, Assistants, and Engineers",
    "summary": "This tutorial categorizes AI coding tools into three tiers of autonomy: Copilots, Coding Assistants, and Software Engineers. It demonstrates a practical workflow using Cursor to leverage these tools for code completion, refactoring, documentation generation, and codebase analysis, emphasizing that Coding Assistants currently offer the highest productivity leverage while autonomous Engineers mature.",

        "AI coding tools exist in a hierarchy of autonomy: Copilots (autocomplete), Assistants (interactive/context-aware), and Engineers (fully autonomous).",
        "Providing specific context (e.g., @filename, @docs) significantly improves the accuracy of AI Assistants for complex tasks like documentation and refactoring.",
        "AI Coding Assistants (Tier 2) currently provide the best balance of control and productivity compared to the immature Tier 3 autonomous agents."
