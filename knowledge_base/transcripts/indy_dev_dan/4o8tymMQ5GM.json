    "title": "Mastering AutoGen: Building Custom Orchestrators for Multi-Agent Control",
    "summary": "This tutorial addresses the consistency issues found in AutoGen's default GroupChat by introducing a custom 'Orchestrator' class. The speaker demonstrates how to manually control agent conversation flows, implementing 'Sequential' and 'Broadcast' patterns to build a robust pipeline that performs database engineering followed by multi-format data visualization.",

        "Separating agents into specialized teams (e.g., Engineering vs. Visualization) with exclusive tools increases reliability and reduces errors.",
        "Manually handling 'function_chat' ensures that tool outputs are correctly propagated to the next agent in the chain."
