    "title": "AI Coding In-browser Text to Speech With Aider",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates a 'zero-code' approach to building a full-stack web application. By feeding external documentation (MDN Web Docs) into an AI coding agent (Aider), the developer orchestrates the creation of a frontend interface and a Python Flask backend. The process highlights the power of context injection, iterative refinement through natural language, and agentic file management to prototype functional software rapidly.",
