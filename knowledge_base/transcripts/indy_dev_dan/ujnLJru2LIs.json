    "summary": "A comprehensive guide to evolving prompt engineering skills from basic CLI interactions to building scalable AI agents. The workflow progresses through four distinct levels: ad-hoc exploration, structured static prompts, example-driven guidance (few-shot), and dynamic templating for software integration.",
