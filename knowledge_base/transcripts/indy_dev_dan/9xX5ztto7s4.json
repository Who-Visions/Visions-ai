    "summary": "A strategic guide for software engineers to evolve into 'Agentic Engineers' by leveraging AI tools like Devin and Cursor. The video argues that engineers must maximize their Asset-to-Liability ratio and treat the fear of AI replacement as a signal to upskill in prompting and system design, rather than a threat to their livelihood.",
