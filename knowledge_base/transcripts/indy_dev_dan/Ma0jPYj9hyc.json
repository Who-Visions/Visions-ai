    "title": "Building a Rapid Learning Tool with Bun and Aider",
    "summary": "This workflow demonstrates how to leverage Bun's unified runtime to build a CLI tool that scrapes technical documentation. The extracted data is then fed into Aider, an AI coding assistant, to automatically generate and verify working code examples. This creates a rapid, agentic learning loop that bypasses manual setup and context switching common in the Node.js ecosystem.",
