    "title": "Cut It Up: Automated AI Video Repurposing Workflow",
    "summary": "A technical breakdown of 'Cut It Up', a Python application that automates the conversion of long-form horizontal videos into multiple short-form vertical videos. The workflow orchestrates WhisperX for transcription, GPT-4 for semantic content selection, and FFmpeg for video processing through a modular CLI architecture.",

            "reasoning": "The 'Brain' of the agent analyzes the transcript to identify interesting segments. It uses strict prompt engineering (e.g., 'end with a period', '20-45s duration') to generate a valid `.sh` script containing FFmpeg commands."

    "key_takeaways": [
        "AI can successfully replace human editorial judgment by analyzing structured transcripts to select 'interesting' content segments.",
        "Robust prompt engineering is critical for agentic workflows; constraints like specific time formats and sentence boundaries ensure the LLM generates executable code (FFmpeg) rather than just text.",
        "A modular, flag-based architecture allows for selective execution of steps (e.g., skipping transcription if already done), optimizing development and processing time.",
        "The 'Do More With Less' principle is achieved by chaining specialized tools: WhisperX for data extraction, GPT-4 for decision making, and FFmpeg for execution."
