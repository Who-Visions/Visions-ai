  "key_takeaways": [
    "The closer the light source is to the subject, the softer the light and the faster the shadow fall-off.",
    "Using a large light source (180cm) creates a 'wall of light' that wraps around the subject.",
    "The zoom rod allows for adjusting the focus and spread of the light inside the reflector.",
    "Remote triggers and apps improve workflow efficiency by allowing setting changes from the camera position.",
    "Keep modeling lights bright to shrink pupils, which generally looks better in headshots."
