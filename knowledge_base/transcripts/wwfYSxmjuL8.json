    "Mixing complementary colored lights (like Magenta and Green) can create white light where they overlap.",
    "Hard light modifiers (grids, zoom reflectors) are effective for emphasizing hair texture.",
    "Using contrasting colors for rim and fill lights (e.g., Pink rim vs Green fill) creates visual separation and pop.",
    "Establish the lighting and pose with a static subject before introducing movement like wind.",
    "Liquify is a crucial tool in hair photography to create shape, flow, and volume that wasn't captured in camera."
