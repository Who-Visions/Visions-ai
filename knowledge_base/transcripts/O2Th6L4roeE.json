      "time": "03:58",
      "action": "Set Luminance to '120 cd/m\u00b2' for desktops (recommended 90 cd/m\u00b2 for laptops) to avoid over-saturation.",

    "Calibrate monitors every 4 weeks to maintain accuracy.",
    "Use D65 White Point and 120 cd/m\u00b2 Luminance for standard photography editing environments.",
    "Avoid using continuous ambient light monitoring if lighting conditions change frequently; instead, control the room lighting manually.",
    "Accurate monitor calibration is essential before editing to ensure prints and web display look correct."
