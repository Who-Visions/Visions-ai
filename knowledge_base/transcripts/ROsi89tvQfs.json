    "Using bare bulbs without modifiers creates hard, poppy, and saturated light ideal for dramatic fashion looks.",
    "When specific clothing isn't available, wrapping fabric can simulate a high-end dress.",
    "Monochromatic looks can be reinforced in post-processing by desaturating conflicting colors (like hair).",
    "Creating work based on trends like the Pantone Color of the Year makes images more relevant to editors and art directors."
