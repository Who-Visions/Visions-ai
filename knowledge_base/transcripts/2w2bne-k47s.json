This hybrid approach allows for precise control and creative effects. His setup is complex but purposeful.\n2.  **Master Light Control:** The use of black V-flats is crucial. Hurley places them strategically to absorb light, prevent unwanted reflections, and create separation between the subject and the background. This demonstrates that controlling light is as important as creating it.\n3.  **Build Rapport with Your Subject:** The atmosphere is relaxed and fun. Hurley's positive energy and clear direction help Dayana deliver a wide range of authentic expressions, from intense looks to genuine laughter. A comfortable subject yields better photos.\n4.  **Utilize Tethered Shooting:** Shooting directly to a computer allows for instant review of images on a large, high-resolution screen. This helps the photographer, model, and team immediately see what's working, check focus and lighting, and make adjustments on the fly.\n5.  **Capture a Variety of Expressions:** Hurley doesn't just settle for a simple smile. He works with the model to capture a full spectrum of emotions, including serious, subtle, and joyful moments. This variety provides the client with a stronger, more versatile set of images.\n6.  **Efficiency is Key:** Despite the elaborate setup, the shoot is described as \"very fast.\" This is a testament to a well-planned workflow, from lighting and tethering to clear communication, which allows for maximum productivity during a session.",
