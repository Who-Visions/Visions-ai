    "The RF 85mm f/1.2 is the best choice for photographers who prioritize creamy bokeh and shooting in low light, though it lacks zoom versatility.",
    "The RF 24-105mm is the ultimate 'workhorse' lens, offering the most versatility for photographers who need to change framing quickly.",
    "The RF 70-200mm is ideal for controlling the environment through background compression and is excellent for tight beauty headshots.",
    "When choosing between f/2.8 and f/4 zooms, consider if the extra stop of light and marginal sharpness increase is worth the significant difference in price and weight."
