    "Use hard light modifiers like optical spots and bare bulbs to create specular highlights on reflective subjects like gemstones.",
    "Start with a standard lighting configuration (Main, Fill, Background, Rims) and modify individual lights to suit the creative vision.",
    "Star filters create beautiful in-camera effects but introduce haze that requires adding contrast and clarity in post-processing.",
    "Optical spots allow for precise control to highlight specific areas without affecting the rest of the image."
