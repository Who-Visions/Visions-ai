Here is a detailed summary and breakdown of the video \"The Jawline\" by photographer Peter Hurley.\n\n### Video Summary\n\nIn this video, photographer Peter Hurley shares advanced tips on how to achieve a strong, defined jawline in photographs, building upon his famous \"It's All About the Jaw\" technique. He identifies common problems that arise when posing, such as tensed neck muscles and awkward posture, and provides practical, anatomy-based solutions for both photographers and subjects to create more flattering and powerful portraits.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown of Key Points\n\n**0:00 - 0:56: The Problem with the Jawline**\n*   **The Pet Peeve:** Hurley's biggest pet peeve in photography is a weak or undefined jawline, where the neck and chin blend together.\n*   **The Core Solution:** The fundamental technique is to have the subject push their jaw forward and out, separating it from the neck. He references his highly popular video, \"It's All About the Jaw,\" which explains this basic concept.\n\n**0:56 - 1:45: The Sternocleidomastoid Issue**\n*   **The New Problem:** When a subject pushes their jaw forward, especially while lying down or in an awkward position, the large neck muscles (sternocleidomastoid) can tense up and bulge, creating an unnatural, strained look.\n*   **The Solution:** To relax these muscles, provide support for the head. By having the subject rest their head against something (like their own hand, a pillow, or the wall), the neck muscles can relax even while the jaw is extended forward. This results in a defined jawline without the distracting tension in the neck.\n\n**1:45 - 2:25: Why Standing is Better Than Sitting**\n*   **Sitting Problems:** When people sit comfortably, their posture tends to slump. Shoulders hunch forward and the neck compresses, which works directly against creating a defined jawline.\n*   **Standing Advantage:** Shooting subjects while they are standing makes it much easier to control their posture, elongate the neck, and implement jawline techniques effectively.\n\n**2:25 - 3:40: The \"Hooking It\" Technique**\n*   **The Concept:** Hurley introduces a visualization technique he calls \"hooking it.\" He instructs the subject to imagine a hook at the crown of their head with a string pulling them straight up towards the ceiling.\n*   **The Result:** This mental cue causes the subject to naturally elongate their entire body and neck. This elongation creates more space between the earlobes and the shoulders, which automatically helps define the jawline and improves overall posture.\n\n**3:40 - 4:40: Posing for Side Profiles**\n*   **The Common Mistake:** When a subject is turned to the side, simply pushing their jaw straight forward can look awkward.\n*   **The Refined Technique:** Instead of pushing the jaw *forward*, instruct the subject to bring their *cheek* (the one closer to the camera) towards the lens. This creates a more natural-looking extension and accentuates the jawline beautifully from a profile or three-quarter angle.\n\n**4:40 - 5:30: Posing for Heavier Subjects**\n*   **The Challenge:** For subjects with a heavier build or less natural jaw definition, more extreme measures may be needed.\n*   **The Extreme Solution:**\n    1.  Have the subject lean forward significantly into a \"three-point position\" (like a runner at the starting block).\n    2.  The photographer must lower their camera angle and shoot slightly upwards.\n    3.  This combination of the subject leaning forward and the low camera angle uses perspective to dramatically define the jawline and slim the face.\n\n**5:30 - 6:08: A Practical Tip for Photographers**\n*   If a client is struggling to understand these directions, Hurley suggests having a short, 30-second clip of his tutorial ready on a phone or tablet. Showing them a visual example can often communicate the concept more effectively than words alone.\n\n### Actionable Insights\n\n1.  **Define the Jaw:** The most crucial step is to have your subject push their forehead and jaw forward and slightly down, like a \"turtle coming out of its shell,\" to separate the chin from the neck.\n2.  **Watch the Neck Muscles:** If the neck muscles (sternocleidomastoid) look tense or are bulging, have the subject rest their head on their hand or another support to relax them.\n3.  **Stand Up for Better Posture:** Whenever possible, photograph subjects standing to avoid the natural slouch and neck compression that comes with sitting.\n4.  **Use the \"Hook\" Visualization:** Tell your subject to imagine a string pulling them up from the top of their head. This elongates the neck and improves posture effortlessly.\n5.  **For Side Profiles, Move the Cheek:** When shooting from an angle, instruct the subject to bring their cheek (not just their chin) toward the camera for a more natural and defined jawline.\n6.  **For Heavier Subjects, Lean and Shoot Low:** Have the subject lean their body forward and shoot from a lower angle looking up to create a strong jawline through perspective.",
