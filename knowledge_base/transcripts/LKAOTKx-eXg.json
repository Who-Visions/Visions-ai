  "title": "Correcting Body Angle and Posture in Headshot Photography",
  "summary": "Photographer Peter Hurley explains how to correct a common posing mistake where subjects angle their bodies away from the camera, creating an unflattering 'lean back' look. He demonstrates two techniques\u2014the 'Hook' and the 'Golfing' move\u2014to straighten the subject's body line relative to the frame, and discusses camera tilting techniques to further refine the composition.",

  ],
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Avoid allowing the subject's body to angle out of the frame, as it makes them appear wider and the pose look awkward.",
    "The subject's body line should be vertical or parallel to the side of the frame for a slimming effect.",
    "The 'Golfing' visualization helps subjects straighten their spine and correct backward leaning.",
    "Tilting the camera to match a subject's forward lean ('untilting') can help maintain a straight body line in the final composition."
