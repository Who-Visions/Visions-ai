The initial results were \"okay.\"\n*   **Learning the Craft:** Realizing he enjoyed it, he turned to \"the school of Google\" and YouTube to learn more. He discovered Peter Hurley's viral video, \"It's All About the Jaw,\" which was a revelation.\n*   **Joining the Crew:** This discovery led him to Peter's online community, then called PH2, which is now the Headshot Crew. He became obsessed with learning and connected with other members.\n*   **Previous Jobs:** Before becoming a full-time photographer, Mike worked as a manager at Papa John's, drove a school bus, worked at a Pepperidge Farm factory, and was a waiter.\n\n**2:23 - 3:45: Transitioning to a Full-Time Photographer**\n*   **The Leap:** Mike made the full-time leap about three years prior to the interview.\n*   **The Turning Point:** He was making enough from photography that his restaurant job became \"fun money.\" After getting an interview for another restaurant job, he realized he didn't want to do it anymore and decided to go all-in on his photography business.\n*   **Building a Client Base:** He has successfully built a consistent clientele, including corporate clients, and travels for shoots.\n\n**3:45 - 5:27: Marketing and Business Strategies**\n*   **Getting Corporate Work:** Mike initially used Thumbtack to get corporate jobs, often shooting for less than he should have to build his portfolio.\n*   **The Power of a Portfolio:** Having a strong portfolio of corporate work allowed him to show potential clients his capabilities.\n*   **SEO is Key:** He emphasizes that his website and ranking high on Google have been a \"game-changer\" for his business.\n*   **Email Marketing Workflow:** Mike has developed a comprehensive email system.\n    *   **Leads:** A \"dripped nurture sequence\" sends tips and follow-ups to potential clients over a month and a half.\n    *   **Booked Clients:** A workflow handles invoices, scheduling confirmations, and proofing.\n    *   **Past Clients:** A follow-up sequence asks for reviews and sends reminders (e.g., after one year) to encourage repeat business.\n*   **Actionable Insight:** He notes that this consistent, automated follow-up is incredibly effective, with clients booking a year after their initial inquiry.\n\n**5:27 - 7:10: The Evolution of His Photography Process**\n*   **Early Days:** His first sessions were long (around 3 hours) as he was still learning. He started by shooting outdoors before finding Peter and learning about studio lighting.\n*   **First Studio:** He began by shooting in his apartment's dining room, then his parents' living room, and eventually their garage.\n*   **Current Studio:** He now shares a professional studio space with another Headshot Crew member, which has significantly improved his business.\n*   **Client Management:** He shares a story about a challenging client who was flustered and difficult. The experience taught him how to manage difficult situations and even be firm enough to tell a client they can leave if the session isn't working.\n\n**7:10 - 9:30: Advice for Aspiring Photographers**\n*   **Shoot More:** The most important advice is to get a human in front of your camera as often as possible. The more you shoot, the faster you improve.\n*   **Build Your Network:** Start building your \"web of awareness\" early. The more people you shoot, the more potential referrals you create.\n*   **Focus on Your Website/SEO:** He advises his younger self to focus on his website and SEO from the beginning rather than relying on platforms like Thumbtack.\n*   **Trust the Process:** It may not feel like you're progressing, but if you keep working, you will eventually get to where you want to be, and often even further.\n\n**9:30 - End: The Value of the Headshot Crew**\n*   Mike emphasizes that being a member of the Headshot Crew means \"everything\" to him and is the reason for his success.\n*   The community provides invaluable resources, support, and a network to compare data and strategies with other photographers in the same market.\n*   He feels a responsibility to \"pay it back\" by helping newer members, just as he was helped when he started.\n\n### Actionable Insights\n\n1.  **Start Now, Perfect Later:** Don't wait for the perfect gear or studio. Start shooting with what you have (even in your dining room or garage) to build your skills and portfolio.\n2.  **Education is Crucial:** Actively seek out knowledge. Use resources like YouTube, online courses, and communities (like Headshot Crew) to learn the technical and business sides of photography.\n3.  **Build a Strong Portfolio:** Even if it means taking lower-paying jobs initially, a strong, specialized portfolio is essential for attracting higher-paying clients.\n4.  **Master SEO and Your Website:** Your website is your most powerful marketing tool. Invest time in learning Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to rank high on Google for relevant keywords (e.g., \"Chicago headshot photographer\"). This will generate organic leads.\n5.  **Implement an Email Follow-Up System:** Create an automated email sequence to nurture leads, manage booked clients, and re-engage past clients. Staying \"top of mind\" can convert inquiries into bookings months or even a year later.\n6.  **Find a Community:** Connect with other photographers. A supportive network is invaluable for sharing strategies, getting feedback, and staying motivated.\n7.  **Practice Consistently:** The single best way to improve is to shoot as frequently as possible. The more people you photograph, the more confident and efficient you will become in your process.",
