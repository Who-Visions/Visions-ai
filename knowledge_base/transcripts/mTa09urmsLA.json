Here is a detailed summary of the video featuring photographer Peter Hurley demonstrating his headshot lighting setup with the Profoto Connect Pro.\n\n### Video Summary\n\nPhotographer Peter Hurley showcases his headshot lighting setup, highlighting how the new **Profoto Connect Pro** allows him to seamlessly control a mix of new and older Profoto lights from his camera. He demonstrates his signature \"triangle\" lighting technique on a model, explaining the purpose of each light and how the Connect Pro streamlines his workflow.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown of Key Points\n\n**1. Introduction & Main Focus (0:00 - 0:13)**\n*   Peter Hurley expresses his excitement for using the **Profoto Connect Pro**, a new remote trigger.\n*   The primary benefit he emphasizes is its ability to connect and control all his various Profoto lights, both new and old, from a single device on his camera.\n\n**2. The Lighting Setup: \"Triangle Lighting\" (0:13 - 1:12)**\nPeter breaks down his multi-light setup, which he has used for years.\n*   **Background Lights (Channel D):** Two **Profoto D1** strobes are used to light the white wall/cyc in the background.\n*   **Key Lights (Channels A & B):** Two **Profoto B10X** strobes are positioned up high on either side of the model, forming the top of his \"triangle\" setup. These are his main lights.\n*   **Fill Light (Channel C):** A **Profoto B1** strobe is placed low and centered, pointing up at the model to fill in shadows under the chin and nose. This completes the triangle.\n*   **Modifiers:** He uses **Profoto OCF Softboxes** (1x3' on the key lights and a 1.3x1.3' on the fill) to shape the light.\n*   **Modeling Lights:** He intentionally turns the modeling lights on all strobes to full power. This serves a specific purpose: to constrict the model's pupils, which makes the colored part of their eyes (the iris) more visible and vibrant in the final shot.\n\n**3. Using the Profoto Connect Pro (1:12 - 1:42)**\n*   The Connect Pro is mounted on his **Canon EOS R5** camera.\n*   It allows him to group different lights onto separate channels (A, B, C, D) for individual power control directly from his shooting position.\n*   **Key Insight:** This is a major workflow improvement. He no longer has to walk to each light to make adjustments. He can control his newer B10X lights and his older D1 and B1 lights all from one central remote, demonstrating the system's backward compatibility.\n\n**4. The Photoshoot & Technique (1:42 - 3:21)**\n*   **Camera & Lens:** Canon EOS R5 with a 70-200mm lens (he mentions shooting around 92mm).\n*   **Camera Settings:** **1/200s, f/4, ISO 100**.\n*   **Directing the Model:** Peter demonstrates his directing style, giving the model (Maya) specific instructions on posing, head tilts, and eye contact to achieve the desired look. He emphasizes creating a connection and getting genuine expressions.\n*   **Shooting Style:** He notes that while he's using the live view screen for the video demonstration, he strongly recommends photographers shoot through the viewfinder to create a more intimate connection with their subject.\n\n**5. Results and Final Thoughts (3:21 - 5:45)**\n*   The on-the-fly adjustments allow him to perfect the lighting ratios quickly.\n*   The fill light from below is crucial for his style, as it eliminates harsh shadows in the laugh lines when the subject smiles.\n*   He reiterates the value of the Connect Pro for any photographer with an ecosystem of Profoto gear, as it \"meshes them all together.\"\n*   The video concludes with a \"Shabang!\" and a call to action to check out the Profoto Connect Pro and subscribe to his channel.\n\n### Actionable Insights\n\n*   **For Headshot Photographers:** Hurley's \"triangle\" lighting setup (two keys high, one fill low) is a proven technique for creating clean, flattering, and well-lit headshots.\n*   **Use Modeling Lights Strategically:** Cranking up the modeling lights isn't just for seeing your setup; it's a creative tool to make your subject's eyes pop by constricting their pupils.\n*   **For Profoto Users:** The Profoto Connect Pro is a significant workflow upgrade, especially if you own a mix of older and newer Profoto strobes. It unifies control and saves significant time during a shoot.\n*   **Connect with Your Subject:** Regardless of your gear, the most important element is your direction and connection with the person in front of the camera. As Hurley advises, get your eye in the viewfinder and engage with your subject.",
