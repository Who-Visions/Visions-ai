🎓 **Workflow Extraction** (Gemini 3 Pro)

Here is the actionable workflow for managing oily skin and grooming on male subjects during a photoshoot, based on Peter Hurley’s tutorial.

### **Phase 1: Initial Oil Control (The "Blot" Technique)**
**Goal:** Remove surface oil without irritating the skin.
*   **Tools:** Select-a-size paper towels.
*   **Timestamp:** 01:19

1.  **Prepare the material:** Tear off a small, manageable piece of a paper towel (half-sheet or "select-a-size").
2.  **Mirror the action:** Tear off a piece for yourself and mimic the motion so the subject follows your lead.
3.  **The Technique:** Instruct the subject to **blot** the skin.
    *   *Critical Warning:* Do **not** wipe or rub. Rubbing causes immediate redness and irritation.
4.  **Target Areas:** Focus on the "T-Zone": Forehead, nose, cheeks, temples, and chin.
5.  **Repeat:** If the subject is a "POB" (Profusely Oily Bastard), have them use a fresh section of the towel and blot again until the paper comes away dry.

### **Phase 2: Deep Oil Removal**
**Goal:** Address persistent oil that paper towels miss, specifically on bald heads or "gushers."
*   **Tools:** Oil Blotting Papers (e.g., Sephora or generic brands).
*   **Timestamp:** 02:43

1.  **Inspect the subject:** Look for shine on the nose and the "noggin" (if the subject is bald/shaved).
2.  **Apply Blotting Paper:** Press the paper firmly against the oily spots.
3.  **Visual Check:** The paper will turn transparent/dark where oil is absorbed. Use this to gauge if more sheets are needed.
4.  **Bald Head Management:** Ensure the entire scalp is blotted to prevent "kickers" (specular highlights from studio strobes) on the top of the head.

### **Phase 3: The "Pro" Mattifying Solution**
**Goal:** Eliminate shine completely and prevent it from returning without using visible makeup.
*   **Tools:** Peter Thomas Roth Max Anti-Shine Mattifying Gel.
*   **Timestamp:** 03:49

1.  **Dispense:** Squeeze a small amount of the gel onto the *subject's* finger.
    *   *Note:* This product is a clear gel, not colored makeup, making it more acceptable to male clients.
2.  **Application:** Instruct the subject to rub the gel between their fingers to warm it up.
3.  **Apply like Sunscreen:** Have the subject rub it vigorously over their face and head (if bald).
4.  **Verify:** Ensure coverage on high-shine areas (forehead, nose, cheekbones). This creates a matte finish that kills hotspots immediately.

### **Phase 4: Eye Visibility (The Eyelash Curl)**
**Goal:** Reveal the iris and pupil if the subject's eyelashes grow straight down.
*   **Tools:** Small/Mini Eyelash Curler (e.g., Sephora brand).
*   **Timestamp:** 06:42

1.  **Assess the Eyes:** If the subject's lashes are covering the pupil or iris (blocking the eye color), intervention is needed.
2.  **The Curl:** Use a small eyelash curler to clamp the lashes.
3.  **Action:** "Jack them up" vertically to clear the line of sight to the iris.
    *   *Note:* Most men have never done this; guide them through it carefully.
