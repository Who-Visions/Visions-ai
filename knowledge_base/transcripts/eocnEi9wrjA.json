  "title": "5 Ways to Modify Natural Light for Portraits",
  "summary": "Professional photographer Lindsay Adler demonstrates five techniques to modify natural light using a garage door as a large soft light source. She covers adjusting subject distance, using reflectors, employing V-flats for positive and negative fill, and changing camera angles to sculpt light for professional portraits.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "time": "01:16",
      "action": "Adjust the distance of the subject from the light source. Moving closer creates top-down sculpted light, while moving further back creates flatter, more even light.",

      "tool": "Garage Door / Natural Light"
    },
    {
      "time": "03:00",
      "action": "Introduce bounce reflectors (specifically a Triflector) to bounce light back into the eyes and fill shadows under the chin.",
      "code": null,
      "tool": "Triflector"
    },
    {
      "time": "05:14",
      "action": "Use white V-flats to bounce light and fill in shadows on the sides of the subject, creating a creamier, softer look.",
      "code": null,
      "tool": "White V-Flats"
    },
    {
      "time": "06:30",
      "action": "Flip V-flats to the black side to create negative fill, absorbing light to deepen shadows and add contrast/drama to the cheekbones.",
      "code": null,
      "tool": "Black V-Flats"
    },
    {
      "time": "07:34",
      "action": "Change the camera angle relative to the subject. Moving to the shadow side creates dramatic lighting patterns like Rembrandt lighting without moving the light source.",
      "code": null,
      "tool": "Camera"
    }

  "key_takeaways": [
    "A garage door acts like a giant softbox, providing a large, indirect light source.",
    "Subject distance affects the directionality and contrast of the light; closer is more top-down, further is flatter.",
    "Reflectors and white V-flats add fill light, reducing wrinkles and adding catchlights.",
    "Black V-flats (negative fill) increase contrast and drama by preventing light bounce.",
    "Since you cannot move the sun or the garage door, moving the subject and camera angle is key to changing lighting patterns."
