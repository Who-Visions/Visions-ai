  "key_takeaways": [
    "Treating maternity shoots with fashion styling (hair, makeup, wardrobe) creates unique, high-end results.",
    "For subjects earlier in their pregnancy (e.g., 6 months), reclining poses and directional lighting help define the bump better than standing poses.",
    "When shooting a subject wearing the same color as the background (monochromatic), rim lighting is essential to create separation.",
    "Using grids on softboxes controls light spill, keeping the background saturated and the lighting dramatic."
