  "steps": [
    {
      "time": "01:37",
      "action": "Set up the background using red curtains on C-stands and a dark grey seamless paper background to create depth and a stage-like atmosphere.",
      "tool": "Red Curtains, Savage Universal Thunder Gray Background"
    },
    {
      "time": "02:43",
      "action": "Introduce a haze machine to add texture to the air, which is essential for making beams of light visible.",
      "tool": "Haze Machine"
    },
    {
      "time": "02:59",
      "action": "Position the first light (background light) high behind the subject pointing down. Use a projection attachment with a 19-degree lens and a purple gel to create a concentrated beam of colored light.",
      "tool": "Nanlite Projection Attachment, Purple Gel"
    },
    {
      "time": "04:28",
      "action": "Set up the main light using an optical spot modifier to create a hard, crisp circle of light on the subject, simulating a stage spotlight.",
      "tool": "Westcott Optical Spot, Strobe"
    },
    {
      "time": "06:15",
      "action": "Add a fill light using a zoom reflector with a blue gel to lift shadows and mix cool tones with the existing purple and pink palette.",
      "tool": "Zoom Reflector, Blue Gel, Profoto Strobe"
    },
    {
      "time": "07:00",
      "action": "Place a fourth light with a 20-degree grid on the side to rake light across the curtains, adding texture and separation to the background.",
      "tool": "20 Degree Grid, Profoto Strobe"
    },
    {
      "time": "07:54",
      "action": "Attach a 4-point star filter to the camera lens to create starburst effects from the specular highlights on the model's sequined dress.",

  "key_takeaways": [
    "Haze is required to make light beams visible in a photograph.",
    "Hard light sources are necessary to maximize the effect of star filters on reflective materials like rhinestones.",
    "Projection attachments can overheat; shooting at lower power with higher ISO/wider aperture helps manage heat.",
    "Using complementary colored gels (like purple and blue) adds dimension and mood to the scene.",
    "Layering lights (beam, main, fill, background accent) builds a complex, theatrical environment."
