  "title": "Mastering Background Adjustments in Evoto with Lindsay Adler",
  "summary": "Professional photographer Lindsay Adler demonstrates how to use Evoto's AI-powered background adjustment tools to save time in post-processing. She walks through four specific studio scenarios to show how to remove distractions, extend backgrounds, clean up footprints, and unify lighting tones.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "time": "00:50",
      "action": "Navigate to the Background Adjustments panel on the right-hand side.",
      "tool": "Evoto Panel"
    },
    {
      "time": "01:12",
      "action": "Enable 'Distractions Removal' to automatically remove studio equipment and extend the background frame.",
      "tool": "Distractions Removal"
    },
    {
      "time": "01:33",
      "action": "Enable 'Clean Backdrop' and select 'Solid Backdrop' to smooth out footprints and dirt on the floor.",
      "tool": "Clean Backdrop"
    },
    {
      "time": "03:25",
      "action": "Turn on 'Unified Lighting' to even out the background tones and remove shadows or grey areas.",
      "tool": "Unified Lighting"
    },
    {
      "time": "03:50",
      "action": "Adjust the 'Luminance' slider within Unified Lighting to create a pure white background.",
      "tool": "Unified Lighting"
    },
    {
      "time": "04:55",
      "action": "Pro Tip: If the background looks too smooth or fake, add a small amount of noise or grain to introduce texture.",
      "tool": "Texture/Grain"
    },
    {
      "time": "05:40",
      "action": "Adjust the 'Amount' slider in Unified Lighting. Lowering it can prevent subjects from looking 'cut out' and maintains natural shadows.",
      "tool": "Unified Lighting"
    },
    {
      "time": "06:18",
      "action": "Enable 'Color Banding Removal' to fix gradient banding issues on grey or solid colored backgrounds.",
      "tool": "Color Banding Removal"
    },
    {
      "time": "07:35",
      "action": "Apply 'Distractions Removal' on complex images where subjects overlap the edge of the background; the AI intelligently masks the subject.",
      "tool": "Distractions Removal"
    }
  ],
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Distractions Removal can automatically extend the frame and remove background clutter even when subjects overlap the edges.",
    "Clean Backdrop effectively removes footprints without creating a smudged or blurry look.",
    "Unified Lighting corrects uneven background exposure, but the 'Amount' slider should be adjusted to maintain realism and natural shadows.",
    "Color Banding Removal is essential for smoothing out gradients on solid backgrounds, especially when darkening images."
