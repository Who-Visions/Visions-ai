He distinguishes between stepping away from the camera for coaching and teaching concepts versus staying locked behind the lens to elicit and capture immediate reactions.",

    "Use 'Camera Talk' (staying behind the viewfinder) when you need to capture split-second reactions.",
    "Step away from the camera when teaching concepts or establishing rapport to avoid hiding behind the gear.",
    "You may need to speak louder when engaging in Camera Talk because the camera body blocks your voice.",
    "The goal is to keep the subject engaged with the lens during the shooting phase."
