  "key_takeaways": [
    "Backlighting is essential when photographing smoke or haze to ensure the particles catch the light and become visible.",
    "The Smoke Ninja Pro offers versatile creative modes beyond standard fog, including a 'Dry Ice' effect that clings to surfaces and smoke-filled bubbles.",
    "Using grids on rim lights helps control light spill, keeping the background dark where intended.",
    "Color gels can be used on multiple lights to create a cohesive color harmony and tint the smoke itself.",
    "Safety is a major benefit of modern handheld smoke machines; the vapor is safe for skin/eyes and the device does not overheat."
