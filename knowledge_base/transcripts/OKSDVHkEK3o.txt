Based on the transcript, this video is a strategic announcement rather than a technical tutorial. However, it outlines a specific **educational and psychological workflow** for photographers looking to transition from specialized headshot photography to broader portraiture using Peter Hurley’s methodology.

Here is the actionable workflow for expanding a photography business from headshots to portraits.

### Workflow: Transitioning from Headshots to General Portraiture

**1. Adopt the "Headshot is a Portrait" Mindset**
*   **Timestamp:** 0:34
*   **Action:** Reframe your thinking. Acknowledge that while not all portraits are headshots, all headshots are portraits. Do not compartmentalize the skills; view headshot photography as a niche within the broader portrait genre.

**2. Apply Headshot Mechanics to Full Portraits**
*   **Timestamp:** 1:20 – 1:45
*   **Action:** Utilize the specific facial coaching techniques used in close-up headshots for environmental or full-body portraits.
*   **Key Parameters:**
    *   **Distance:** The techniques apply regardless of distance (3 feet vs. 30 feet).
    *   **Jawline:** Continue to direct the subject to accentuate the jawline.
    *   **The Squinch:** Apply the "squinch" technique to convey confidence, even if the face is a smaller part of the frame.
    *   **Facial Sides:** Continue to analyze and shoot the subject's "good side."

**3. Engage with the "Portrait Track" Curriculum**
*   **Timestamp:** 2:56 – 3:15
*   **Action:** Begin education with the **Headshot Intensive Online**.
*   **Context:** This specific module covers the theory of portraiture and insights from a photo consultant. It serves as the foundational theory before moving into practical shooting.

**4. Integrate Portrait Work into Community Feedback**
*   **Timestamp:** 3:40 – 4:00
*   **Action:** Do not separate portrait work from headshot communities (specifically the Headshot Crew).
*   **Steps:**
    *   Post general portrait work for critique alongside headshots.
    *   Start conversations regarding lighting and posing for broader framing.
    *   Participate in "CrewCasts" focused specifically on portraiture.

**5. Execute the Career Growth Roadmap**
*   **Timestamp:** 5:00 – 5:15
*   **Action:** Use the skills developed in the portrait track to diversify income streams beyond the studio headshot.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Build a comprehensive portrait portfolio (distinct from the headshot portfolio).
    *   Seek representation (Agents).
    *   Target Commercial and Editorial work.
