This video, titled "CONTROLLIN' THAT COLLAR," features Peter Hurley passionately demonstrating how to properly style shirt collars and ties for headshots, highlighting common mistakes and offering practical solutions.

Here's a detailed summary:

**Overall Theme:** Peter Hurley emphasizes that poorly styled collars and ties can ruin a headshot by drawing unwanted attention and creating an unprofessional look. He provides specific, actionable techniques to ensure these elements enhance, rather than detract from, the subject's appearance.

**Key Points & Actionable Insights:**

1.  **The Pet Peeve: Collars Out of Place (0:00)**
    *   Hurley introduces his strong aversion to seeing collars that are messy, flattened, or not sitting correctly in headshots. He stresses the importance of controlling these details.

2.  **Women's Collars: Jacket Lapel vs. Shirt Collar (0:17)**
    *   **Problem:** Many photographers (and subjects) allow the shirt collar to go *over* the jacket lapel. Hurley demonstrates this, calling it "not cool," "a mess," and "ridiculous" because it flattens the collar and draws attention to the white shirt area, distracting from the face.
    *   **Solution:** The jacket should be against the back of the neck, and the shirt collar points should be tucked *inside* the jacket lapel. This creates a clean line and highlights the lapel, which is generally more flattering.
    *   **Actionable Insight:** Always ensure the shirt collar is *under* the jacket lapel for a polished look.

3.  **Men's Casual Collars: The "Pull and Pop" (1:48)**
    *   **Problem:** A casual shirt collar that is flat, too far from the neck, or uneven looks sloppy. Hurley demonstrates this with his own plaid shirt.
    *   **Solution:** Perform a "pull and pop" maneuver. Pull the collar up and away from the neck, then pop it down. This helps the collar sit upright and closer to the neck. Ensure the collar points are even and pointing downwards.
    *   **Actionable Insight:** For casual shirts, use the "pull and pop" technique to give the collar structure and ensure evenness.

4.  **Men's Formal Collars & Ties: Mind the Gap & The "Crumpler" (2:44)**
    *   **Problem:** When wearing a suit and tie, common issues include a gap between the neck and the shirt collar, or between the shirt collar and the jacket. This looks "unbearable" and unprofessional. Also, a poorly tied or flat tie knot is undesirable.
    *   **Solution for Collar Gap (The "Crumpler"):** For collars that are too big (e.g., due to weight loss), take a half-sheet of paper towel, crumple it into a small ball (a "little ball of goodness"). Place this crumpled ball *behind* the neck, under the shirt collar, to push the collar forward and eliminate the gap.
        *   **Strategic Placement (4:07):** If the subject is turned, place the crumpler on the side *
