  "key_takeaways": [
    "The photographer must mirror the subject to effectively communicate body positioning.",
    "Head movements should be isolated from body movements to maintain the pose.",
    "Scanning for hair and clothing issues is a critical step that must happen before shooting.",
    "Eliciting a reaction through verbal stimuli is the most important part of the system.",
    "The entire 7-step process is designed to be a split-second pre-shutter checklist."
