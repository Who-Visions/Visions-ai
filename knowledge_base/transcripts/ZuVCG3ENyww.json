It can be subtle and elegant or loud and experimental. This allows for creative freedom based on your resources and vision.\n*   **Focus on the Creative Trio:** To create an avant-garde look, focus on the interplay between three key elements: **hair, makeup, and wardrobe**. Pushing the boundaries in one or all of these areas is fundamental to the style.\n*   **Experiment with In-Camera Techniques:** Simple but effective techniques like multiple exposures, lens filters, or intentional motion blur can elevate a look from standard beauty to avant-garde.\n*   **Use Lighting Creatively:** The trailer heavily features dramatic and colorful lighting (using gels or colored LEDs). Using hard light, colored light, and strong shadows can significantly contribute to an experimental and high-fashion feel.",
