  "title": "The Tilt Un-Tilt Maneuver for Headshots",
  "summary": "Photographer Peter Hurley demonstrates a technique called the 'Tilt Un-Tilt Maneuver' to improve headshot poses. By having the subject tilt their body to accentuate the jawline and simultaneously tilting the camera to match their angle, the subject appears upright in the final image while gaining the benefits of the pose. This technique requires a clean background to avoid tilted horizon lines.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "time": "00:50",
      "action": "Ensure you are shooting on a clean background (e.g., seamless paper). Do not use this technique with architectural lines or horizons in the background.",
      "tool": "Studio Background"
    },
    {
      "time": "02:12",
      "action": "Position the subject by having them turn their body slightly and drop their front shoulder.",
      "tool": "Posing"
    },
    {
      "time": "02:50",
      "action": "Loosen the tripod head or center column to allow for camera rotation.",
      "tool": "Tripod"
    },
    {
      "time": "03:34",
      "action": "Instruct the subject to drop their shoulder significantly to stretch the neck and define the jawline.",
      "tool": "Posing"
    },
    {
      "time": "03:52",
      "action": "Tilt the camera physically to match the angle of the subject's shoulders. This 'un-tilts' the subject in the viewfinder, making them look vertical relative to the frame.",
      "tool": "Camera"
    },
    {
      "time": "04:14",
      "action": "Refine the pose by asking the subject to push their forehead out and chin down toward the camera.",
      "tool": "Posing"
    },
    {
      "time": "05:04",
      "action": "Verify the background. If lines (like buildings or windows) are visible, they will appear crooked, revealing the trick. Stick to solid backgrounds.",
      "tool": "Background Check"
    }
  ],
  "key_takeaways": [
    "Tilting a subject helps define the jawline but can look unnatural if the camera remains level.",
    "Matching the camera's tilt to the subject's shoulder axis makes the subject appear straight in the final image.",
    "This technique is strictly for clean backgrounds; visible vertical or horizontal lines in the background will ruin the illusion."
