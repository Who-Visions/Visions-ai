Here is the actionable workflow for correcting subject posture in headshot photography, based on Peter Hurley’s "Golf Swing" technique.

### **Tools Required**
*   **Camera:** DSLR or Mirrorless with a portrait lens (typically 85mm or 105mm).
*   **Tripod:** Essential for maintaining a consistent frame while coaching the subject.
*   **Tethering Setup:** (Optional but recommended) To review images immediately with the client.

### **Workflow: Correcting the "Lean Back" Posture**

#### **1. Identify the Problem: The "Lean Back"**
*   **Timestamp:** 00:15 - 00:58
*   **The Issue:** Subjects often angle their body away from the camera. The hips go forward, the shoulders go back, and the head tilts backward.
*   **The Result:** This creates an unflattering line where the body looks wider, the neck disappears, and the subject looks disengaged.
*   **Goal:** You want the body vertical or leaning slightly forward, with the face closest to the lens.

#### **2. Step 1: "The Hook" (Vertical Alignment)**
*   **Timestamp:** 01:00 - 01:15
*   **Instruction:** Tell the subject to imagine a hook in the top of their head pulling them straight up.
*   **Action:**
    *   Subject stands up straight.
    *   Subject pushes their forehead out and down (chin down slightly).
*   **Note:** If the subject still leans back after this instruction, proceed to the "Golfing" technique.

#### **3. Step 2: "The Golf Swing" (Forward Engagement)**
*   **Timestamp:** 01:18 - 02:25
*   **Setup:** This works best when the subject’s body is turned 45 degrees (sideways) to the camera.
*   **Instruction:** Ask the subject if they have ever golfed. Tell them to imagine holding a putter.
*   **Action:**
    1.  **The Grip:** Have the subject clasp their hands together in front of their waist as if holding a golf club.
    2.  **The Stance:** Have them get into a "putting stance." This naturally forces the shoulders forward and the butt back (eliminating the backward lean).
    3.  **The Lift:** Tell them to imagine the golf ball is rising on a tee. Have them slowly lift their hands (the "club") up toward their chest.
    4.  **The Freeze:** Once their posture is leaning slightly forward and engaged, tell them to freeze.

#### **4. Step 3: Finalizing the Pose**
*   **Timestamp:** 02:55 - 03:10
*   **Action:**
    *   Once the upper body is in the correct forward-leaning position, instruct the subject to drop their hands to their sides (or pockets) without moving their shoulders or spine.
    *   **The Head:** Instruct them to "Jam your forehead out" toward the camera lens.
*   **Result:** The body line should now be going straight down or angling slightly forward out of the frame, rather than angling backward.

#### **5. Step 4: The Camera Counter-Tilt**
*   **Timestamp:** 03:05 - 03:15 & 04:20 - 04:35
*   **Technique:** If the subject leans significantly forward (using the Golf technique), their face plane may no longer be parallel to the camera sensor.
*   **Action:**
    *   Tilt the camera lens slightly downward (or forward) to match the angle of the subject's face.
    *   **Why:** This "untilts" the perspective, making the subject look like they are standing straight up in the final image, while retaining the slimming benefit of the forward lean.

#### **6. Review and Analysis**
*   **Timestamp:** 03:25 - 04:50
*   **Comparison:**
    *   **Before (Leaning Back):** Body line angles away from the frame. The arm and torso appear wider/heavier.
    *   **After (Golf Technique):** Body line is vertical or forward. The subject appears significantly slimmer, and the connection with the camera is stronger.
