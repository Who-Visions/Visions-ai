# Analysis: GPT Image 1.5 vs. Gemini ("Nano Banana")
**Source:** (85) Did ChatGPT Just Kill Nano Banana? - YouTube
**Date:** 2025-12-16 (Approximate context)

## Executive Summary
This report analyzes the comparison between OpenAI's new "GPT Image 1.5" model and Google's "Nano Banana" (Gemini) model. The video highlights GPT Image 1.5's improvements in speed, text rendering, and multi-step editing while noting Gemini's strengths in photorealism and image consistency.

## GPT Image 1.5 Key Updates
*   **Performance:** Generates images up to 4x faster.
*   **Cost:** API costs are ~20% cheaper.
*   **Likeness Retention:** New feature allowing one-time reference image upload for consistent character generation across sessions (similar to Sora's Cameo).
*   **UX Improvements:**
    *   Dedicated "Images" tab with style presets (Pop Art, 3D Glam Doll, etc.).
    *   Discovery feature for trending prompts.
    *   Ability to queue generations (don't have to wait for one to finish).
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Precise Editing:** Better at adding/removing/blending elements while preserving lighting/composition.
    *   **Text Rendering:** Handle dense markdown, headers, and small text significantly better.
    *   **Instruction Following:** Improved spatial reasoning (though still imperfect).

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature/Test | GPT Image 1.5 Performance | Gemini ("Nano Banana") Performance | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Image Editing (Remove Person)** | Good facial preservation, added "neon" lighting as requested. Removed extra people unpredictably. | changed pose/face significantly but kept background very consistent. | **Tie** (GPT for faces, Gemini for background) |
| **Multi-Step Editing Consistency** | Remembered the "chain" of edits (Snow -> Age -> Art -> Cabin). | Maintained original image coherence better but "lost the plot" on complex chain (reverted to kitchen at end). | **GPT Image 1.5** (Better context memory) |
| **Spatial Reasoning (Grid Test)** | Failed count (10 vs 9 boxes). Missed some object borders. | Failed count (10 vs 9 boxes). Followed specific object instructions better (e.g., folded map). | **Gemini** (Slight Edge) |
| **Text Rendering (Pricing Page)** | Sharp, legible, correct formatting (Markdown headers). | Fuzzy, looks "upscaled", harder to read. | **GPT Image 1.5** |
| **Style Transfer (3 Eras)** | Created 3 distinct, high-quality portraits side-by-side. | Overlapped and stylized images confusingly. | **GPT Image 1.5** |
| **Crowd Realism** | Faces looked AI-generated/uncanny. | Photorealistic, looked like a real concert photo. | **Gemini** |
| **Brand Consistency (Logos)** | Consistent logo across items in one image. | Consistent logo across separate images. | **Tie** |

## Conclusion
"Nano Banana" (Gemini) retains a slight edge in **photorealism** and **compositional consistency**. However, **GPT Image 1.5** has made significant strides in **utility**—specifically text rendering, complex multi-step instruction following, and user experience (speed/presets).

For "Ai with Dav3", this suggests GPT Image 1.5 is the superior tool for **marketing assets** and **mockups** (text based), while Gemini remains the go-to for **photorealistic creative generation**.
