Everyone is talking about OpenAI's new **GPT Image 1.5**. It’s faster, cheaper, and finally got rid of that weird yellow tint. But does it actually beat Google's **Gemini** (aka "Nano Banana Pro")?

I didn't just want to generate pretty portraits. I wanted to break these models. I ran them through a gauntlet of stress tests—from math homework to circuit diagrams. Here is what I found.

## where Gemini ("Nano Banana") Dominates 🍌
Gemini proved it is still the "World Sim" champion. It understands how the world is structured physically and logicially.
*   **Spatial Reasoning:** When asked to generate depth maps or floor plans, Gemini nailed the layout. GPT Image 1.5 just hallucinated.
*   **World Knowledge:** From complex circuit diagrams to identifying celebrity faces in a group shot, Gemini's knowledge graph is unmatched. GPT Image 1.5 refused to generate celebrities and messed up the diagrams.
*   **Data Viz:** I fed it a messy table of medical data. Gemini not only read it but calculated the percentages and plotted a perfect chart. GPT missed half the data.

## Where GPT Image 1.5 Wins 🚀
OpenAI has focused heavily on **utility**.
*   **Text & UI:** If you need a screenshot of a YouTube page or a pricing table, GPT Image 1.5 renders text crisply with zero typos. Gemini still struggles with "AI spew" text.
*   **Emotions:** GPT Image 1.5 captured subtle expressions like "Relief" and "Jealousy" remarkably well.
*   **Math:** It solved a handwritten math assignment perfectly and kept the handwriting looking natural.

## The Verdict
If you are an artist or data pro needing **realism and accuracy**, **Gemini** is still your go-to. It understands the physics of light and the structure of diagrams better than anything else.

But for **day-to-day utility**—making quick mockups, social posts, or solving problems—**GPT Image 1.5** is a fantastic (and free) tool to have in your belt.
