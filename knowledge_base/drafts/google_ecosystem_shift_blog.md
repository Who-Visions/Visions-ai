It feels like a vibe shift is happening. For the last year, the stack was obvious: ChatGPT + Cursor + Perplexity. But recently, I've been cancelling subscriptions and moving my entire workflow to Google.

Why? It’s not just about saving money (though $20/month for everything is insane value). It’s about arguably the biggest asymmetric bet in tech right now.

## 1. The "Wartime" Shift
Sergey Brin is back in the office writing code. That’s the signal. Google isn't playing nice anymore; they are in "Founder Mode". They are shipping faster, releasing models like **Gemini 2.5** (Nano Banana) that top the leaderboards, and they are listening to devs.

## 2. Anti-Gravity: The Agentic IDE
We all love Cursor. but Google's new **Anti-Gravity** IDE isn't trying to be a better text editor. It’s an **Agentic-First** environment.
Imagine an IDE where you don't just write code, but you manage a squad of agents ("Project Jewels") that fix bugs, branch repo, and run tests. Because Google owns Chrome *and* the IDE, these agents can control the browser natively for testing in a way no third-party tool can match.

## 3. The "Infinite Money" Glitch
Google owns the chips (TPUs). They don't pay the "Nvidia Tax". This means they can give us:
*   **2 Million Token Context Windows**
*   **Free Tiers** that would bankrupt a startup
*   **Gemini CLI** with generous free limits compared to Cloud Code

## 4. Total Vertical Integration
Perplexity is great, but they are renting the map. Google *is* the map.
With **NotebookLM**, I can paste a YouTube video link, and it understands it instantly because they own YouTube. I can highlight text in Docs and have Gemini rewrite it because they own the office suite. It’s one seamless pipe from prototype to production.

## The Consensus
I’m giving it 90 days. No Cursor. No ChatGPT. All-in on the Google ecosystem.
Will they kill "Anti-Gravity" in 2 years like they killed Reader? Maybe. That's the risk. But right now, the value and the power of the "Google Stack" is too big to ignore.

*Are you ready to switch, or is Cursor still king? Let me know!*
