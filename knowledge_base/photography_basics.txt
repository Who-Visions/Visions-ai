# Photography Basics for Visions AI

## The Exposure Triangle
Photography is built on three pillars: Aperture, Shutter Speed, and ISO.
1. **Aperture (f-stop):** Controls depth of field. Low f-numbers (f/1.8) blur the background (bokeh). High f-numbers (f/11) keep everything sharp.
2. **Shutter Speed:** Controls motion. Fast speeds (1/1000s) freeze action. Slow speeds (1/30s) blur motion.
3. **ISO:** Sensitivity to light. Low ISO (100) is clean. High ISO (3200) is noisy/grainy.

## Composition Rules
- **Rule of Thirds:** Align subjects on the grid lines that divide the image into thirds.
- **Leading Lines:** Use natural lines to guide the eye to the subject.
- **Negative Space:** Leave empty space around the subject to create balance.

## Visual Style Guide
- **High Contrast:** Prefer punchy, dramatic lighting.
- **Vibrant Colors:** Saturation should be slightly elevated but natural.
- **Storytelling:** Every image must have a clear subject and narrative.
