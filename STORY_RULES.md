## 🏗️ MODULE 1: TALKING-HEAD STORYTELLING

### 1. Structure (The Foundation)
*   **The Hook**: Must happen in the first 3 seconds. Needs a "Pattern Interrupt".
*   **The Setup**: Who, What, Where. Context is king, but keep it brief.
*   **The Inciting Incident**: The moment everything changes. "Suddenly..."
*   **The Struggle (Rising Action)**: No struggle, no story. Show the difficulty.
*   **The Climax**: The peak emotional moment or realization.
*   **The Resolution**: The "New Normal" and the lesson learned.

### 2. Enhance (The Polish)
*   **Sensory Details**: Don't say "it was loud," say "my ears were ringing."
*   **Dialogue**: Use active dialogue, not reported speech.
*   **Pacing**: Fast for action, slow for emotion. Silence is a tool.

### 3. Find (The Source)
*   **Everyday Moments**: The best stories are often small, relatable moments, not epic adventures.
*   **The "So What?"**: Why does this story matter to the audience?

### 4. Common Mistakes
*   **Over-explaining**: Trust the audience to connect the dots.
*   **Buried Lead**: Don't take 2 minutes to get to the point.
*   **Weak Stakes**: If we don't care if you succeed/fail, we click off.

## 📱 MODULE 2: IMMERSIVE SHORT-FORM (Vertical/Reels)

### 1. Structure (Velocity)
*   **The Visual Hook**: Motion/Text within 0.5s.
*   **The Loop**: The ending should feed back into the beginning.
*   **Micro-Beats**: A change in visual/audio state every 2-3 seconds.

### 2. Enhance (Visual Language)
*   **B-Roll Match**: Footage must *strictly* match the spoken word.
*   **Text Overlays**: Kinetic typography to emphasize keywords.
*   **Sound Design**: Wooshes, risers, and hits to guide attention.

## 🎬 MODULE 3: IMMERSIVE LONG-FORM (YouTube Main)

### 1. Structure (The Arc)
*   **The Promise**: What will they get by the end? (The Thumbnail/Title payoff).
*   **The Stakes**: What happens if they *don't* watch?
*   **The Midpoint Reversal**: A surprise twist or change in direction halfway through.

### 2. Enhance (Cinematic Depth)
*   **Music Swells**: Score the emotion, don't just put background filler.
*   **Visual Variety**: Change locations, angles, or focal lengths to avoid fatigue.
*   **The "Nano Banana"**: (Our term) - Specific, weird details that make it memorable.

## 🗣️ MODULE 4: DELIVERY

### 1. Camera Confidence
*   **Eye Contact**: Look at the lens, not the monitor.
*   **Energy**: +20% energy than you think you need.

### 2. Speaking Excellence
*   **Tonality**: Vary pitch and volume. Monotone = Death.
*   **Pauses**: Pause *before* the important word, not after.

## 🚫 THE GHOST // ECHO CONSTRAINT CHECKLIST

**Before any generation, ECHO must verify:**
1.  [ ] **Is there a Hook?** (First 3s defined?)
2.  [ ] **Are there Stakes?** (What is lost if the character fails?)
3.  [ ] **Is there a Struggle?** (Is it too easy?)
4.  [ ] **Is the Resolution Earned?** (Does it pay off the hook?)
